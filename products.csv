"""I'm still waiting for my money""",1,10,2021-01-28,Trip Verified,✅ Trip Verified |  AirAsia X cancelled my flights last April 2020. After confirming they were refunding my money in 10 weeks nothing happened. It´s 2021 and I'm still waiting for my money. 
"""they stated my case was closed""",1,10,2021-01-23,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was amazed at their decision of a no reply email sent to me after 9 months of trying for a refund to my personal account in which you had already promised me and have registered. I was promised a refund of money to my bank  9 months ago after many hour and emails talking to the computer generated eva--- covid 19 shut Australia. I have still not received, when i enquired they stated my case was closed."
"""finally get our refund""",1,10,2020-12-01,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  We've had to jump through so many hoops to finally get our refund. But we did finally get it, 10 months later! It should be noted the information herein would only apply to people who received a refund/credit option after flights were cancelled, not those only receiving a credit offer. Time line: 13 Nov 2019: book flights for 7 April 2020. 18 March: flights cancelled, received email from Airasia offering refund/credit options. 18 March: log in to Airasia account, open chat, select refund, informed to expect refund within 3 weeks. 22 March: Australia closes borders. 9 April: (the end of their 3 week processing time) to 8 September, multiple attempts to contact them, all fail. Chat bot completely useless, go around in circles, contact via Facebook, no call centres, no email contact, again, all designed to make it almost impossible to contact anyone there. 8 September: file chargeback claim with visa card. 10 October, chargeback rejected by Airasia, conveniently 2 days after the validity time of the claim, thus no possibility to have the claim re-examined by card provider. 12 October: File complaint with our local consumer protection agency. 12 October: Consumer protection contacts Airasia, they obviously have an email address for a real person, unlike the rest of us who have only Aisasia chat bot contact. 13 October: Airasia requests bank account details for refund, with the same processing time frame of 3 weeks. 12 November (4 weeks later) refund received.

"""a great budget airline""",10,10,2020-08-19,Not Verified,"Not Verified | Kuala Lumpur to Gold Coast in December 2019. I like to fly Air Asia as it is a great budget airline. They win awards year after year, I will fly them again."
"""take your money and keep it""",1,10,2020-06-07,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  Denpasar to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur. I paid for my ticket, 6 days later the flight is cancelled, there are no available flights for a month. 3 other carriers are going my route. Airasia refuse to refund the ticket. Insisting I take credit for flights not even available. We all understand that flying during Covid 19 is difficulty. This policy is shameful if you cannot carry the passenger return the payment. To contact AirAsia you have to use a robot called Ava or social media. Ava put me in a 3 hour queue where I have to watch the screen was there is a 60 second window to get access. It took me 10 hours to be watching at the right time then the result is no help or refund Alternatively you can use social media, my DM on Twitter to support is idling in the their box for 48 hours with no response. I recommend that passengers be very early of AirAsia at this time they post non existent flights then take your money and keep it."
"""unable to submit my claim""",1,10,2020-04-20,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a round trip ticket from Australia to Sri Lanka in December 2019. I was due to departure on 26.03.2020. I was informed on 22.03.2020 by E mail that my departure flight is canceled. I understand that cancellations are unavoidable due to the prevailing situation. I received a generic E-mail that AirAsia will refund our money (though they encourage us to get the credit). This was two weeks ago and I am still unable to submit my claim. I am disgusted with the process of submitting my claim through the AVA (virtual assistance service). I have tried to submit my refund request, as instructed by them. There AVA is a nightmare. I have spent hours and I am going in circles for the last two weeks. They do not have an Australian address, telephone or e-mail to contact them."
"""the worst customer support""",1,10,2020-03-30,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Fukuoka. AirAsia has the worst customer support ever. I could not be able to reach them and been trying multiple days already. The only way to contact them is through website chat, which is a not so smart bot first if it cannot handle your request and try to send you to another link, that's where I have been wait forever. No email inquiry and no phone. The 24hour support is totally scam."
"""separated our group""",3,10,2020-01-22,Not Verified,"Not Verified |  Our family of five (2 adults & 3 kids, aged 12, 11 & 7) recently flew Air Asia from Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne. Air Asia ""auto assigned"" seats at online check-in that separated our group, which placed our 7 year old seven rows behind the rest of the family even though there were plenty of seats of 5 together on the flight, leaving us no option but to purchase seats. Also, we hired their tablets for entertainment but one didn't work. The cabin crew advised us to contact their customer support who weren't interested."
"""departed and arrived on time""",7,10,2020-01-12,Trip Verified,✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Kuala Lumpur. Flight departed and arrived on time. Was seated in the third last row so there was slightly more space as it was a 2-3-2 configuration for the last few rows as compared to the usual 3-3-3. Meal service was rather slow as it took a long time before anyone passed by for me to order some food. Cabin crew were hit & miss - Some were professional while some looked like they would rather be anywhere but serving customers on a plane.
"""found it a comfortable flight""",9,10,2020-01-04,Trip Verified,✅ Trip Verified |  Traveled from Kuala Lumpur to Chitose on Air Asia. It was an overnight flight. I found it a comfortable flight. Check in was easy and was able to relax when on board getting a window seat automatically allocated. I believe I had a spare seat next to me so I was comfortable. I will fly them again.
"""able to sleep a little bit""",10,10,2020-01-03,Not Verified,Not Verified | I traveled from Kuala Lumpur to the Gold Coast on a rather full Air Asia X flight. I was able to sleep a little bit on the flight. I will fly them again.
"""commend two cabin staff""",10,10,2019-12-01,Not Verified,Not Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to Sydney. I want to commend two cabin staff that were wonderful ambassadors on my flight back from Kuala Lumpur to Sydney on 24 November 2019. Their names are Krijana and Bina. They were the two most hardworking members of staff on that flight and the patience and courtesy displayed by them made my flight comfortable and enjoyable. They were friendly and patient and served passengers with a smile. I will fly Air Asia anytime as long as you have staff like these two young ladies.
"""an easy profit for them""",3,10,2019-11-28,Not Verified,"Not Verified |  Perth to Denpasar via Lombok. It puzzles me that I can fly by AirAsia internationally and carry 23 kg then have to dump 8kg if my connecting flight is domestic with them. Where was I to put this, in the extra bag of course that I did not have. So at Rp100000+ per kilo excess that's an easy profit for them. "
"""pay for an aisle seat""",2,10,2019-11-26,Trip Verified,✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur. I request for an aisle seat in the middle row. They say it is a full flight and I need to pay for an aisle seat in the quiet zone. I found out there were empty seats on this flight. I feel cheated.
"""Children under 5 in sleeper cabin""",3,10,2019-10-30,Not Verified,Not Verified |  Children under 5 in a sleeper cabin? Fortunately the mother was very attentive to her children's needs however the half dozen times they did get upset and cry was enough to wake us each time rendering the choice of a sleeper cabin redundant and had we been informed of this we would have chosen a ‘hot seat’ saving 600 each. Also attitude of attendants was the worst we have experienced. 
"""Very adequate service throughout""",10,10,2019-10-20,Trip Verified,✅ Trip Verified |  Osaka to Bangkok. Very adequate service throughout for a budget airline. Food small portions but tasty. Plenty of toilets and room to walk about. Nice clean aircraft left a little late but arrived early.
"""would not accept our debit mastercard""",1,10,2019-10-12,Trip Verified,✅ Trip Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to Perth. On October 9th My husband and myself boarding on flight D7 239 at KL airport ready to come home to Perth. Our flight before was delayed so we had to rush to this flight at 11.25pm so that the plane could leave at 12:05am. During this time we had no time to get anything to eat at the airport as the boarding gates were already open for us to get on to our flight so we just figured we would order food and drinks on the flight. We got on the flight and asked if we could get a movie package to which they said yes. When it came to paying for some entertainment and food and drinks the lady would not accept our debit mastercard as that was all we had for payment. So for 5 hours we were hungry and thirsty with not even water to drink. Next time we will pay extra money to fly with a better and more efficient flying company.
"""seat pitch is not satisfying""",2,10,2019-09-24,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to Fukuoka. A refurbished older plane, boarding is quick with a full flight, crew was showing restlessly eager and impertinent at this midnight red-eye flight. Crew disappear after meal service. Dark mode cabin for passenger to rest. The Korean Sweet and Spicy Chicken (Dakgangjeong) prebook meal is hard and cold and seat 29K the seat pitch is not satisfying. Thanks to the tailwind we land early."
"""did not get what I paid for""",5,10,2019-09-07,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur. The plane was delayed by 20 minutes because they were waiting for a passenger. I have never heard of this happening before. On the way back to Melbourne I was sitting in the hot seat which is positioned just at the back of premium class. The hot seat is in the quiet zone where there are supposed to be no babies, however there was a baby in premium class who was crying much of the time. I paid extra to sit in this area and did not get what I paid for."
"""they do great job""",10,10,2019-09-06,Trip Verified,✅ Trip Verified |  Gold Coast to Kuala Lumpur was an eight hour flight. Boarding was orderly. Announcements were few. It was a bit cramped in my row. I had a meal which was nice. I will fly them again as they do great job.
"""their seats are so cramped""",1,10,2019-07-20,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  Phuket to Melbourne via Kualar Lumpur. Barely existent customer service and their seats are so cramped making a long haul flight a nightmare. The lights are on for a good chunk of the flight making it difficult to get any shut-eye. They have a nonsensical policy that phones must be ""turned off"" for takeoff and landing - not switched to flight mode, but turned off - and they enforce it. Prior to booking, there was an issue with the booking and trying to speak to their customer service left me fuming. Their Australian contact number was engaged on the 10+ times I tried to call it. To chat with them online you have to get past their online bot which is a real pain when it doesn't understand your problem. The person I spoke to was absolutely rude and unhelpful. The chat closes after 60 seconds of inactivity which is infuriating when you have to go off and find information. "
"""Delay after constant delay""",1,10,2019-07-15,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok Don Mueang to Osaka with AirAsiaX. Delay after constant delay. Even boarding the plane is delayed by half an hour. The motto of this company should be ""never on time"". Horrible experience, not even counting the nickle and diming."
"""overwhelmed by their service""",9,10,2019-07-08,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to Gold Coast return. The outgoing flight was okay, as a night flight there was nothing much to do but try to sleep. The return flight was a day flight which leaves OOL at 1035am. The crew on D7 201 from OOL to KUL on 6th July 2019 were the best airline crew I have ever encountered in about 40 years of flying! They were polite, pleasant, engaging and nothing seemed like too much trouble for them. I was just overwhelmed by their service and grace. Well done to Air Asia. The downside is that their seats are awful, they fit an extra seat into the A330 economy section which means 3-3-3 abreast instead of 2-4-2 in most other airlines. The seat width is terrible, aisles are very narrow but the seat pitch is okay. The food was good, plenty available for purchase on the way out but they seemed to run out of many things on the return flight to KL. The ground staff at KLIA2 are awful. The seem so ineffectual and when boarding, there was no announcement over the loudspeaker so everyone just got up to board, ignoring the families with kids and older people. They need to sort out their boarding procedures in KLIA2. The ground staff at OOL are a little brusque and in particular, a rude lady who was on the plane prior to departure. She snapped at passengers as the crew wanted to do a head count and some people were still standing to adjust their luggage in the overhead bins. I would fly them again just for the crew."
"""Most uncomfortable flight""",1,10,2019-06-25,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  Beijing to Kuala Lumpur. Most uncomfortable flight I've been on. The cabin was freezing. As a low-cost airline, a blanket had to be paid for and water also cost extra. Meals were provided to those who reserved in advance or buy onboard. No in flight entertainment, no place to charge electronics. The seats were hard and ramrod straight.  I will not ever be flying this airline again."
"""professional and pleasant""",8,10,2019-04-29,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  Red eye flight from Kuala Lumpur to Perth on 17 April. The flight leaves at 0005 and arrives into Perth at 0530. Boarding was shambolic as there was one lady in charge up front and she spoke fast and her speech was so unclear that nobody understood her and everyone just got up and boarded anyway. It was storming before takeoff so we waited on the tarmac after boarding in the middle of a thunderstorm. The flat seat was comfortable and they provide a duvet and a large pillow for sleep. You are given a small complimentary bottle of water and a tablet with noise cancelling headphones. The tablet is loaded with a limited number of movies and TV shows and lasts about 4 hours. I don't understand why they serve you food at 0030 (I was not given a choice, just handed a tray of food) after takeoff instead of serving it before landing. The cabin crew were very professional and pleasant but boarding announcements were appalling as the purser was a Japanese man and although no fault of his, his accent could not be understood by virtually anyone on the aircraft. Quizzical looks all around! All in all, they were punctual, efficient and pleasant. One drawback. They turn on the lights about an hour before landing when we easily could have had an extra 30 minutes of sleep. Points to improve: your staff need elocution lessons on clear speech."
"""our luggage didn't arrive""",3,10,2019-04-20,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our return flight from Langkawi to Avalon through Kuala Lumpur started with a flight time change, originally departing at 6pm our plane was re-scheduled to 7:55pm. As we proceeded through the gate to the tarmac (Premium Flex) we were instructed to wait at the stairs as there were 2 elderly people in wheelchairs who needed to board via the lift system. After some time we were then told to board through the back of the plane. After approaching the rear stairs we were then waved back by the pilot to the front. We ended up being one of the last to board seated in 1B and 1C, boarding was totally disorganized. A further delay due to this meant we arrived even later to KL airport, however we proceeded through customs before anyone and made our way to our connecting flight. With 2 x Premium Hot Seats we were able to navigate our way onto the next flight with little issue. On arrival into Avalon we were once again through customs quite quickly as we were able to exit the plane first. However our luggage didn't arrive. How was it that no-one in KL was able to ascertain that our luggage didn't make the flight? They had 8 hours to call ahead, actually 9 hours seeing we waited over an hour for our luggage. What disappoints me is the treatment from the staff and total lack of communication from AirAsia. You cannot contact AirAsia in Australia, teir Sydney number goes back to KL. We never received a call, text or email from AirAsia X. We left all our details at the airport for them to contact them. But the saga continues. After multiple emails to KL I found out that our bags were placed on 2 different flights. One later in the day and the other one the next morning. The bags arrived on separate flights and were separates in the lost luggage area of Avalon Airport, one even included a large hand written note saying ""Waiting for other bag arriving on D7 218"". The bags continued to sit there separated for a further 24 hours, still no call, email or text. Ringing KL they said the bags were there but yet once again you can't call ANYONE in Australia. Instead they give you the number for AVALON, which welcomes you with ""Welcome to Jetstar"" and had no reference to AirAsia. It was only though the assistance of a lady at Avalon Administration who knew the Air Asia supervisor that a direct call was made. Finally my bags were reunited and given to a courier at 7:30pm 3 days after departure. I was told they would be with me by 8:30pm. At 9:30pm I received a call from the courier saying he won't be coming until tomorrow as he'd also had to go to Geelong. I stood my ground, told them they had destroyed my evening and had no choice but to bring me my bags. Finally I received them at 11:30pm that night. Close to a week has past and I still have not received a call, text, email or apology from Air Asia."
"""Why bother with self service""",6,10,2019-02-11,Trip Verified,✅ Trip Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to Sydney. Why bother with self service to speed up the process to then have only 2 counters for document verification? The queue is long and slow. If you have done so much to speed things up why let this final process to taint the effectiveness and efficiency? I always fly AirAsia. It is economy airline and they have done well on a lot of fronts and to come this far itself is an amazing achievement. I am just very curious why this decision and this process?
"""Seats are okay""",7,10,2019-01-30,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flying from Bangkok to Tokyo. Plane left as scheduled, arrived on time in tokyo Narita. Very friendly inflight staff, and good ground staff as well. Nothing particular on the flight itself, no free food, no inflight entertainment, it's a low cost airline. I felt cold in this flight and I suspect the airline to lower the temperature inside the plane to make you buy there cover, so just prepare a small jacket and that will be fine. Seats are okay, better than short flight budget airline."
"""inflight staff were really nice""",7,10,2019-01-30,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flying from Seoul Incheon to Bangkok. Well, was not too bad at all. Plane was on time, arrived in Bangkok a little bit early, thanks to good wind I suppose, inflight staff member were really nice and smiling. On the other hand, there is the lack of inflight entertainment, but with some movies on my PC it was ok, and no free food. I bought some snacks before taking the plane and it was enough. But I suspect the airline to lower the temperature inside the plane so you will have buy them some cover. I felt really cold compared to many other airline I took...fortunately I had a jacket with me."
"""Fantastic value for money""",9,10,2019-01-15,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Auckland via Kuala Lumpur. Fantastic value for money especially when one finds a promo or random very low fair. The food was good and very cheap too as well as the beer. Bought a warm meal for under €5 and beer was around €3. Will be flying this airline over the major carriers when possible, after all what do you miss out on, free food and drink and an entertainment screen? Seats are a little cramped but not enough to grumble about really. The layover in Gold Coast is an annoying factor in this leg though. Not once were my carry-on bags checked for weight so could have easily packed more in my luggage."
"""not comfortable to say the least""",6,10,2019-01-12,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified | Tokyo Haneda to Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia X. Flight departed and landed on time. Did not pre-book a seat and was allocated a middle seat, which was not comfortable to say the least. Cabin crew were a little slow in starting meal service and hence I had to wait some time before I could purchase a drink. Was an overnight flight so largely napped for most of the time."
"""a satisfactory flight""",8,10,2019-01-09,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo Haneda. Flight departed on time & arrived early, although was forced to wait on the tarmac as parking Bay was occupied by another aircraft. Was randomly allocated a seat in the Quiet Zone, a welcome stroke of luck. Pre-booked an onboard meal, chicken Teriyaki rice, which was pretty decent. Flight attendants were professional & polite, and the captain was clear & prompt in his announcements. Overall a satisfactory flight."
"""changed my seat after take-off""",6,10,2019-01-05,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  Seoul Incheon to Kuala Lumpur. The check in counter only opened 2 hours before flight and the queue to check in was so long. There were no self check in kiosk. We were in the airport 5 hours before flight. We were in a rush to catch up the flight as we had to take train to the gate. After we boarded the aircraft and put our luggage in the compartment, the aircraft was out of power due to problems with Ground Power Unit(GPU). The pilot did an announcement regarding it but no estimation time given. Passengers were still boarding at this time with limited light and small aisle. It’s really not worth it to pay for hot seats and having to face awful stuff. But kudos to one of the cabin crew on the flight who  saw me having difficulties dealing with crying babies and changed my seat after take-off. "
"""leg room was so small""",6,10,2018-12-15,Trip Verified,✅ Trip Verified |  Denpasar to Auckland via Kuala Lumpur. The seat was not confortable and the leg room was so small. Definitely it is not recommended to travel with AirAsia X for a journey more than 2 hours. Entertainment system was not available on board.  The flight attendants are getting better. 
"""We are now so frustrated""",1,10,2018-11-24,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  We bought return tickets in early March 2018, flying from Kuala Lumpur to Osaka in end October 2018. There were 2 cancellations made by AirAsia without notice. Both had no notice or email given until we noticed the changes ourselves when we were surfing the website to purchase add-on. The 1st cancellation was made somewhere in June to early July, original flight to Osaka cancelled and they moved it to 2 days later than the original. We filed complaints through email and Twitter, and expressed our dissatisfaction on the cancellation and changes without notice immediately, and request for flight change as the date is not preferable. Entitled for free reschedule, we moved the date to early November. The 2nd cancellation was made soon after the reschedule done in early July till early August, same scenario as previous, no notification! We noticed the changes ourselves in the website, filed another complaint through Twitter, and the only thing we can do is either get a refund or free reschedule. Nothing else. Noticed there were complaints about the delays and difficulties in getting the refund from Airasia, we decided to make another flight reschedule to late November. Our departure flight now is 2am on 24 November (tomorrow). And this early morning (today) we received an email informing us that there will be a delay in our flight for 2 hours. We are now so frustrated and yet worried there will be another delay in the flight later. Another note, the response from Airasia's customer care or support team is very disappointing. Response received from Twitter somewhat acceptable, which they took about 5 hours to 1 day to reply, but as long as you have decided the date to reschedule to, they somehow managed to get it done quickly. However, there was no response from our email complaints about the first cancellation that we made in mid-July, until end-August where we have already made our second reschedule (in mid-August) after the second cancellation without notice. And the email was only reflecting the first cancellation and first reschedule that we made in July. Soon after the email, Cancellation Notice was sent to my inbox to notify the first cancellation, after 2 months, and it wasn't even valid at that time anymore."
"""Very happy with the 2 flights""",8,10,2018-11-20,Trip Verified,✅ Trip Verified |  Amritsar to New Chitose via Kuala Lumpur. Very happy with the 2 flights I had with AirAsia X. Flights were on time. Staff were friendly. Very reasonable price. Seats are comfortable and leg room is sufficient.
"""more than 6 weeks to reply""",1,10,2018-09-14,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to Sydney on low-fare ticket. Service was manic and disorganised, often bordering on rude. For an 8 hour flight I wasn't offered a free glass of water. Essentially they know you're going to pay. Emailed them with some feedback and took them more than 6 weeks to reply. Pay the extra and fly with an airline that actually has some thought about their passenger."
"""not hearing a word from them""",1,10,2018-09-13,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  We bought return air tickets from AirAsia X for travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Sapporo-Shin-Chitose  on last Sunday (9 Sep) and return on 17 Sep. A strong earthquake hit Hokkaido on September 6, damaged buildings and infrastructure, airport and caused many landslides, airport closure and power outages, AirAsia published an announcement on their website news room later on the same day for the service recovery options for guests traveling on these flights from 8 - 11 September. We were afraid most hotels, restaurants, and shops would remained closed, we decided to retain the value of our booking in AirAsia BIG Loyalty account. We monitored our mailbox and SMS closely but never receive an email from AirAsia for so called service recovery option. We called multiple calls to AirAsia Malaysia call centre and tried to reach to their customer support via LiveChat, Twitter, Facebook, and even wrote to them and completed e-form several times since 8 Sep till today 12 Sep. All methods we have tried but not hearing a word from them. We did not take flight but we did not get refund in any form. We bought value packs which includes standard seat selection. However, I noticed AirAsia is charging us the seats when we tried to select standard seats on the website after the booking is confirmed. Even we tried to get hot seats, the initial seats are not refund. There are many unhappy, frustrated customers like us."
"""charged for the extra luggage""",1,10,2018-09-11,Not Verified,"Not Verified |  Colombo to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur. My wife and I have travelled from Sydney to Trichy in July. I purchased the baggage for 25kg each but the actual weight was only 15kg each. The airline said that they cannot downgrade the allowance once it is paid. When we came back from Colombo to Sydney in August, we got 6kg over weight. Therefore I have tried to increase the allowance from 25kg to 30kg for each. I have spent about 5 hours in my phone and several attempts to increase the allowance, but the Airasia system did not allow me to do so. Although it is their system issue, I was charged for the extra luggage at very high rate at the Colombo airport and I was advised to get the refund at KLIA. The customer service person at the KLIA advise me to try the telephone customer support team. The telephone customer support team asked me to fill an eForm to get the refund. But the airline has treated me with suspicious instead of investigating the failure of their system. I have only requested the refund of surcharge fee at the airport (i.e. difference between the online fee and the airport fee for the additional luggage). "
"""if approved I will get my money back""",1,10,2018-08-07,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne. Upgraded to flatbed only to be advised on boarding that the seats were double booked and sent back to cramped seats with no leg room. Advised I need to request them to investigate via e-form to get my monies returned. Told the investigation may take a week or so and then only if approved I will get my money back for a service they never supplied. So far its cost me $800.00 for nothing. Not sure if they will refund or not.  Thought I would give them another chance this time, what a mistake that was. "
"""a few minutes error""",3,10,2018-08-06,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  I've flied with AirAsia many times, the seats are quite cramped and everything costs extra but the prices are very cheap when booked in advance. However at Kuala Lumpur (Klia2) airport I got lost and had a lot of luggage so I had to use the lifts which would only take me up one floor at the time - it took me ages to get to Departures. I was able to check in at the Self check in machines and I even got my luggage tags but when I arrived at the Baggage drop 5 min later, the staff said that she can't accept my bags anymore (the flight was leaving in 55 min). I went to complain to the Customer Service desk and the staff was very unhelpful and rude couldn't care less that I was going to miss a flight because of a few minutes error. I asked about different options and they only offered to ""change"" my flight for next day which would have cost me AUD 960 - I had paid AUD 160 for my flight. I ended up sleeping at the airport and taking another flight next morning through Bali with another company which was a little cheaper than the option that they had offered me."
"""say thank you to him""",8,10,2018-07-31,Not Verified,"Not Verified |  Gold Coast to Kuala Lumpur. A male aircrew who had served me at the same flight made my worth experience with AirAsia X. I was kind of in panic at that time under strange surroundings and my bad condition with long journey. However, I was impressed when he asked me ‘may I help you?’ at totally out of his field and he took care me till I could go to my stay safely, more than 2h. As a person who does customer service too, I was more grateful that I can understand it is hard to do after hard-working. Doing so, even though I cannot really remember his name, I want to say thank you to him by this review. The moment inflight was not bad, it was right there what I expected. Nevertheless, his service- mind changed my mind to head to AirAsia again."
"""They refused to compensate""",1,10,2018-07-19,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had a flight from Sydney to New Delhi with a 1 hour 15 minute layover in Kuala Lumpur. Apprehensive about the layover, I called Air Asia customer care to check what happens if I miss my flight and I was assured that if the first flight is delayed, the connecting will also be delayed and I will not miss my flight to New Delhi. But I did miss my flight thanks to an hour long delay in Sydney. I was then asked to either stay at the airport for 5 days (I didn't have a Malaysian visa since it was transit only) or fly to another city in India and of course I picked the latter. But then I had to book another flight for myself early in the morning at for 2am to get to my home city with exorbitant charges. They refused to compensate in any way."
"""I would definitely fly again""",8,10,2018-07-05,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have always been a regular traveler for Air Asia since it started year during the late 90's. And thanks to Air Asia, I had been to many countries that I had never thought I would be going. This May 2018 I'm flying for the first time to Shanghai via Kuala Lumpur from Miri. My flight was suppose to be 5:30pm but it was delayed until 8pm, and my connection flight was 11:30pm from Kuala Lumpur to Shanghai. The time I arrived Kuala Lumpur it's already 10:45pm and I have to run like crazy person in order to get to my departure gate. The seat was not comfortable for the 5 hours flight, but I had flown before more than 5 hours, so, I have to accept the seat was meant to be like this, and I just need to find my own way to have a good rest. I would say the best part of the flight was the food actually, which I pre-ordered and I really enjoy the meal. I like also the interaction between the Cabin Crew with the passengers. I would definitely fly again and again. As long as the price is affordable, and the food is good!"
"""we were pleasantly surprised""",10,10,2018-06-29,Trip Verified,✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Phuket via Kuala Lumpur. Just want to say we were pleasantly surprised. We had not flown Air Asia before but the cabin crew and a special mention to Joyce who was very friendly consistently smiling throughout the 8 hour flight and helpful.
"""I like AirAsia""",10,10,2018-06-27,Trip Verified,✅ Trip Verified |  On 22nd June I fly on AirAsia from Kuala Lumpur to the Gold Coast. I had to do a document check and it was carried very efficiently. Lots to do in the airport so my transit did not seem that long. Boarding was smooth with extra check taking place to ask security questions. At KUL you stay in the gate area until they open the gangway. I had seat 48C an isle which was comfortable and easy to go to the bathroom. I like AirAsia and I will fly them again.
"""Fabulous flights""",9,10,2018-06-15,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  Fabulous flights with AirAsia X yet again. Both long flights were overnighters so the lie flat beds are brilliant. Service was excellent as was the food. First two flights on time but coming home half an hour delay from Phuket to KL & then the flight into Gold Coast was half an hour late arriving too but, very minimal. Didn't use the entertainment. Just slept & read. Just brilliant that these Premium/Business class flights are affordable even by us. Could never afford it with a full service airline."
"""had not pre-paid for this""",1,10,2018-04-22,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  Honolulu to Osaka. When booking I paid for 2 checked bags at 30 dollars a piece, not bad. When returning we had extra bags which needed to be checked but we had not pre-paid for this. At the airport, they demanded a counter fee for checking in at $123 dollars a piece! This is extortion. 4 times the price because you did not check a box online? It was not just me that dealt with this as no less than 10 passengers around us were irate with the same issue. "
"""limited music and films""",7,10,2018-04-21,Trip Verified,✅ Trip Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne. I enjoyed the flight. It included the use of the Air Asia Lounge at KLIA2 which was a nice surprise. Check in was efficient and friendly and the plane left on time. The pre purchased food they served was very tasty. Much better then Jetstar. It was a pity they couldn't offer a choice of a continental breakfast in the morning including cereal and juice although I was happy with Nasi Lemak. IFE was not worth the trouble. Very limited music and films. The quality of sound was poor as well. I was also amazed that it was only possible to by 3 cans of Tiger Beer! It was not possible to purchase one only. Not a sensible decision.
"""charge extra for everything""",1,10,2018-03-25,Trip Verified,✅ Trip Verified |  Gold Coast to Kuala Lumpur. No inflight entertainment. Seats are rock hard and sit too upright. Absolutely freezing so make sure you bring a coat as they charge you for a blanket. They entice you into a flight with great prices to realise they charge extra for everything a full service airline give you as standard.
"""Staff are courteous""",8,10,2018-03-16,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified | I was very skeptical about this, as people had informed me that the flight gets delayed, they cancel the flights often due xyz reasons, but I took a shot and booked two way tickets with meals and checkin baggage as an add-on. I travelled Economy. Web Check In Process: Seat Selection automatic, and three step check in, even if you have not purchased baggage, meals at the time of purchasing the ticket, it can be done at the time of web check in, at the same cost. The Meals served were of the best quality, quantity and taste and value for money. Pre-booking a meal saves you 45% of what you pay for the same on board. Yes water is chargeable on these flights, do carry your own water bottle. The seats for the AirAsia X flights have ample leg space and are good enough for an 8 to 9 hour journey. Staff are courteous and very well groomed, no complaints from that side, very pleasant people. Inflight entertainment has to be carried on your own, ipads, laptops as seats dont have screens, but for the price we pay for ticket I have no regrets. The flight infrastructure from the interior is good, even the toilets are always clean. So except for the water part which was a surprise to me, paying 3 Ringgits for 300 ML Water, approx rupees was a bit disappointing. The rest was a pleasurable experience."
"""appreciation to the staff""",10,10,2018-02-26,Trip Verified,✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Ho Chi Minh City via Kuala Lumpur. Fantastic flight to KL. I had recently broken my toe and was an Economy passenger. The help and consideration I received was outstanding and my thanks and appreciation to the staff on that flight. I have never flown AirAsia before and I must say I had low expectations of this budget airline but I was pleasantly surprised indeed. Many thanks for ensuring I had a comfortable flight. I will definitely fly AirAsia again!
"""service on board was pleasant""",9,10,2018-02-15,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified | On the 15th December 2017 I travelled from Pattaya, Thailand to Jakarta, Indonesia on Air Asia. I had to change in Kuala Lumpur for my second and connecting flight. The connection was bearable. The service on board was pleasant. We arrived very early in the morning in Jakarta so I had to sleep for a few hours before catching a local bus to Jakarta City. I always try and fly Air Asia."
"""I will fly AirAsia X again""",8,10,2018-02-14,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled AirAsia X from Osaka to Honolulu on the 2nd February 2018. I booked in economy for the seven hour flight, I ordered a chicken meal in advance which was given to someone else sitting in front of me even though they had seen my boarding pass a minute or two before. I made a protest and got my meal back slightly opened, but not eaten. All around a reasonable flight. I will fly AirAsia X again."
"""$200 charge for bags""",2,10,2018-01-18,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified |  Tokyo to Denpasar Bali. The worst flight we’ve ever had. We are on our honeymoon and had to pay the equivalent of $100 for each bag (two 8kg backpacking bags). When we sat on the plane, we were not together. The plane was almost empty - we asked to switch and they hesitated and then told us a specific area we could sit in. Why wouldn’t the check in counter seat us together? We had prebooked our seats, but that didn’t matter. No water or tea service is served free. We bought one small meal and couldn’t afford anything else. The toilet was out of soap and paper towel. Honestly all of that would have been fine if it wasn’t for the $200 charge for bags and not being able to get free water."
"""crew were really friendly""",8,10,2017-12-30,Trip Verified,✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Delhi via Kuala Lumpur. I got a great price on the premium flatbed and decided to try it. The seat is an angled flatbed but was remarkably comfortable and I managed to get a good few hours sleep. You also get an Ipad with entertainment and a meal but you have to pay for drinks. The crew were really friendly and efficient. For a budget airline they did a great job. I was surprised at how good the journey was for a 15 hour trip and I didn't feel at all tired when I arrived. 
"""staff have horrible attitudes""",4,10,2017-12-30,Trip Verified,"✅ Trip Verified | Beijing to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur. Will avoid this airline like a plague in the future. I lately thought it was ok to fly with AirAsia and quickly realised it was not the case. The phone customer service was friendly but the ground and inflight staff have horrible attitudes. Just because you are budget airline, you are not being paid to be rude and treat customers like low class citizens. My stupidity led me to fly long haul where I was assigned a seat right at the back of the plane. For $100-200 I should have chosen another airlines. Lesson learned the hard way."
"""prebooked meal for bento delicious""",8,10,2017-11-12,,"✅ Verified Review |  Osaka to Honolulu. Flight was so full, some of the attendant is rushed, impatient and surly, while it was fun chatting beside galley while it last. The prebooked meal for bento was delicious but selection choice should be more varied. The cabin is hot mostly."
"""mobile app doesn't even work""",5,10,2017-09-19,,"✅ Verified Review |  Osaka to Kuala Lumpur. After checking in online I'd still have to queue for a long time to drop my bag. Also, what's the point of having mobile apps if the mobile app doesn't even work? I can't even view my boarding pass there and the apps keeps shutting down."
"""Well worth for the money""",9,10,2017-09-14,,"✅ Verified Review |  Kuala Lumpur to Gold Coast. My pre-book meal delivered without any mistakes. Food is acceptable , clean and tidy. Staff are very polite professional. When fasten seat belt sign come, They follow strict rules. Toilets are kept clean throughout the journey. Must better than some full paid airlines. There are no television which is good you can sleep without disturbances. Well worth for the money."
"""staff were really friendly""",8,10,2017-09-11,,"✅ Verified Review |  Lovely flight from Kuala Lumpur to Osaka with AirAsia X. Plane was on time and clean, staff were really friendly, plenty of food and purchase food options although they had run out of ice-creams. Return flight issue was that on-line check in was not working, see picture which meant I had to pay for additional luggage even though we had already paid for 3 bags on the first leg because we only used 1 bag on that leg we still had to pay £45 extra. The guy at check in could not waive this fee even though he understood our issue but he moved us to extra leg room seats as a compensation. Good total price paid and both airports are excellent so will definitely use this route again."
"""disappointing experience""",2,10,2017-08-29,,"✅ Verified Review | My mother and I were really excited to be flying with AirAsia X as it was considered the best low cost airline. However, our flight from the beginning until the end was a disappointing experience. To begin with, the ground staff didn't even greet us with a smile as if she was mad whilst doing her job. Then we realised our seats weren't together so we asked, and she rudely told us that we had to pay extra to be seated next to each other (we don't mind paying the extra fee, by the way. But we would've appreciated it more if we were told about it nicely). Then the whole entire flight, not a single smile on the faces of the crews. One crew member, whilst doing the safety procedures sighed and made an eye roll. Thankfully, the person sitting beside my mother was really nice and was helping her out throughout the flight but overall, we were really disappointed with their service and we have experienced better service at other low cost airlines."
"""chose the wrong date""",1,10,2017-08-28,,"✅ Verified Review |  Sydney to Bangkok via Kuala Lumpur. I resently booked a flight with AirAsia X and chose the wrong date. I straight away tried to contact AirAsia. After 1 hour in the waiting line for the live chat I was informed call again during their office hours. For the date change I was charged about the same amount as the flight itself. Plus got a flight with a 12 hour long waiting time at the airport. AirAsia X used to be one of my favorite arlines, but the customer service experience was very disappointing this time."
"""it was really great.""",5,10,2017-07-04,,✅ Verified Review |  Perth to Bangkok via Kuala Lumpur. My wife and kids flew on AirAsia and we're quite delighted with the lie flat seats and service on board. It was really great. Thank you. The food though needs a little work and could be improved. On a negative though is the communication using the app. We were charged for lounge access when it should have been included in premium. It does seem the booking system makes errors with charging and I see on the return we are being charged for food when we selected that option in our fare. In essence there is a lot over double charging which I don't appreciate. I have just tried the app to complain and it says I have already completed a form yet I have not. It is a shame because it seems that are getting a lot right in the air. A pity that the systems lead to overcharging and frustration. 
"""there was a huge line""",2,10,2017-07-01,,"✅ Verified Review |  I have booked return tickets from Singapore to Tehran, with a transit at Kuala Lumpur. The outbound flight from Singapore to Tehran was all fine, but during the return flight I had to get out at Kuala Lumpur airport and get in again without any reason given. It wasn't a very good experience since there was a huge line and immigration checking took around 3 hours, not mentioning the visa on arrival costed extra. Until now, no staff has given me a valid reason."
"""needed to cancel our flight""",1,10,2017-06-19,,"✅ Verified Review |  Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh City via Kuala LumpurWe try to fly on a budget, and we have flown on various airlines. I have an online account with Air Asia so that I can make bookings when we fly. Now, when talking about experiences, overall, it is what it is - nothing spectacular, nothing bad. We decided to organise a small holiday for my wife's family in Vietnam, to travel to their hometown. Later, my wife decided she wanted to join in, so we made a booking for her, with Air Asia being the cheapest at the time of booking. As time progressed, my wife had gotten pregnant. So, we needed to cancel our flight.  Unfortunately, due to Air Asia's terms and conditions, we could not get our money back. Their cancellation fee was massive too. With no other choices I agreed, submitted all the paperwork required. What happened next was just a series of frustrating emails back and forth, as calling them was useless as they couldn't do anything, but would refer you to use their online system. Going through that meant 1-2 business day waits for replies. And the issue I was having was they would not give me the account credit. They said that they could only give the credit to the passenger's account, or to the person who made the payment. So my account doesn't count, because the passenger was my wife, not me. In the end, I had to make a new account, one for my wife, so they could finally give the account credit. Fine, after all the hassle, we have the credit, substantially less than what we paid. Going forward, since we can't fly as my wife is pregnant, and I need to work and save up money, that credit goes to waste. "
"""Overall a positive experience""",7,10,2017-05-28,,"✅ Verified Review |  Sydney to Kuala Lumpur. Relatively painless baggage drop and boarding process. Clean cabin although low interior lighting most of the time and toilets were messy half through an 8-hour flight. Staff were friendly, efficient and impressively firm with some guests standing up and making mobile calls when taxiing for takeoff. On board food and beverages have also improved noticeably. Overall a positive experience with this D7223 flight."
"""was a great travel experience""",8,10,2017-05-06,,"✅ Verified Review |  Kuala Lumpur to Perth. Best low cost airline. On time departure, nice clean aircraft, excellent options in food and beverage, staff with excellent service attitude, decent pitch between seats. It was a great travel experience at a very low cost, excellent value. I will travel and recommend Air Asia anytime"
"""Premium flatbed is great""",9,10,2017-05-03,,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew premium flatbed from Perth to Kuala Lumpur then A320 onto U-Tapao. Premium flatbed is great. Not exactly flat and if you're 183cm tall like me your feet do hang off the end of the foot rest but a huge improvement over economy. 1 small bottle of water provided plus another with the pre-booked (included) meal. Meals are large and tasty for a budget airline. Tablet provided free with movies/TV etc but a rather limited choice. Alcohol, soft drinks and additional food can be purchased. The 2 centre seats are probably best as you do not have to clamber over people to use the restroom and row 1 they seem to have more leg room than the other seats due to the position of the bulkhead. For night flights row 2 is probably more preferable as the light from the galley can be bothersome in row 1 although it is turned off after main service. Provides complimentary access to Premium Red Lounge which is OK. Limited complimentary food and drink offerings but it's somewhere to relax. Smaller planes do not have flatbeds (A32x) but you can sit in row 1. Booking on 1 ticket does allow ""fly-thru"" meaning luggage automatically goes to final destination and you don't need to pass through Malaysian immigration. However, sometimes this works out considerably more expensive than booking the 2 flights separately, but then you do have to pick up luggage, pass through immigration and re-check-in for next flight. I did this on my return and was a bit of a faff but did save me nearly $150 compared to ""fly-thru"" on the 1 ticket. All up for the price I paid it was very good and I would fly again in a heartbeat if prices remain competitive."
"""wouldn't recommend it""",2,10,2017-04-30,,"✅ Verified Review |  Xi'an to Kuala Lumpur. It was an overnight 5 hr flight and we purchased Premium Flatbed class. The tickets included meals as a separate line item. We checked in online but were told to check in again in the airport. The check-in counter for Premium class was very slow. Once in the aircraft we had one bottle of water each next to our seats and nothing else was offered.  In flight service in general was non-existent. Flatbeds were great. It was first experience when the airline neglected to provide part of the service. Most likely, we would never fly AirAsia X again and wouldn't recommend it."
"""pre-record your messages""",6,10,2017-04-28,,"✅ Verified Review |  Perth to Siem Reap return via Kuala Lumpur. I always fly with ear plugs in my ears and I recommend anyone who doesn't have hearing loss to consider purchase these before flying with them. There are non-prerecorded announcements occuring approximately every 45 minutes on a typical 5.5 hour flight. The volume of the announcements is set to a level that is painful and wakes you from your sleep even if you have hearing protection. The food is not bad and they run on time. But please just turn the volume down, dim the lights more and pre-record your messages so we can actually enjoy travelling on you more often."
"""I'd book with them again""",8,10,2017-04-20,,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew AirAsia X from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur to Phuket then the same on the return. Planes were new and in great condition, all flights bar a little turbulence were smooth and I am not a good flyer. You want a bargain price with good decent planes I recommend AirAsia, I was hesitant in booking with them and after 4 flights in their planes I'd book with them again at their prices.
"
"""no need for such rudeness""",1,10,2017-04-14,,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew from Kuala Lumpur to Taipei. Arrived at the airport 2 hours before the flight and hard the announcement that we had to proceed to a check-in counter immediately. Walked to the counter but no one was there and the 'closed' sign was up. When the attendant finally appeared, I asked what the urgency was or if the flight time had been changed. This was out of curiosity as both our flight to and from Bali the previous week had been delayed. The attendant immediately gave a very curt reply ""your check-in time closes at 9.00 and if you're late, we cannot be responsible"". There was no need for such rudeness. I then pointed out that passengers should not be summoned to a counter simply to find it closed. Her reply was, ""well, we can't satisfy everyone"". Ironically, it was all for nothing as I am now sitting at the gate 40 minutes past the stated boarding time and there is no movement. Undoubtedly, it will be our third Air Asia flight in 10 days to be delayed. I should also add that even when some of the reviews mention the delightful array of food on offer, there is almost certainly no chance that you will get your choice if you haven't pre-order.
"
"""much cheaper than other airlines""",7,10,2017-03-04,,"✅ Verified Review |  Kuala Lumpur to Auckland via Gold Coast. This was my first time to Auckland, and I decided to take AirAsia X as the fares were much cheaper than other airlines servicing the route even though their flights were direct. It was a pleasant flight and the landing at both airports were good. One thing which bothered me, though, was the checking of bags and belongings at OOL. The food that I ordered was a bit overcooked. Other than that, it was perfect."
"""flight was not that full""",7,10,2017-03-03,,"✅ Verified Review |  Auckland to Kuala Lumpur with a short stopover at Gold Coast. The flight was not that full, and the plane was able to depart 5 minutes early. The flight was smooth all the way until a few hours before landing, turbulence was evident but the captain was able to minimise it. This time, the food that I ordered (roast chicken with stuffing and cranberry gravy) was really dry, and the accompanying vegetables were unpalatable. Landing at KUL was a bit bumpy."
"""seamless transfers through KLIA2""",8,10,2017-02-03,,"✅ Verified Review | Sydney to Cochin via Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia X. Was pleasantly surprised by the legroom offered on both the aircraft. Their punctuality is to be praised. Pleased with the selection of food and beverages available for purchase, that too at a very reasonable price. AirAsia X offers good connections to Asia from Australia, with seamless transfers through KLIA2. Would highly recommend for budget travelers."
"""FA serving my row was most friendly """,4,10,2017-01-02,,"✅ Verified Review |  Been through flying AirAsia X more than 15 times and service can be inconstant.  On my recent flight from Auckland to Gold Coast, the flight was barely half full for the evening flight, so we departed early, After the seatbelt signs turn off the cabin staff did not appear until about an hour later starting the meal services. The pre-booked meal out of Auckland was overcooked, bland and small portion. They didn't give a set of plastic cutlery, instead only giving the spoon for the meal. When asking the knife and fork one of the FA reply that the meal only need spoon and we have deficient for the fork for this flight. A complimentary mineral water was not served until asking them. At Gold Coast we disembark with stairs and after the transit check we board again with new set of crew, for this 7hr 50 flight , a lovely Australian or New Zealand FA serving my row was most friendly that I have had encounter with - she kneeled down when interacting with every passenger."
"""they served free meals""",7,10,2016-12-26,,"✅ Verified Review |  Kuala Lumpur to Tehran. It was my first time taking Airasia X and I didn't expect too much from it, since it is a low-cost airline. I almost missed my flight (because of the traffic in the airport), but the plane has not departed, even though it had passed the boarding time. Inflight, the seat is small but everything looked okay-ish, nothing special. During the flight, they served free meals. The meals were decent. Surprisingly, they gave you free mineral water (served in bottle) which was unexpected, since they usually charge you for that (at least a short-haul flight).  I ordered a food online, but they did not serve me, which was disappointing. Overall, it was okay."
"""on board, the seats were horrific""",8,10,2016-12-12,,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Perth to KUL, 11 December, D7233 in economy section of the quiet zone with Air Asia X. At Perth airport, boarding was announced according to zones which was totally ignored by passengers and gate crew alike. The check-in was prompt and efficient but lacking any friendliness but that's fine as long as the job is done well. On board, the seats were horrific. They are 3-3-3 abreast on what should be a 2-4-2 arrangement. If you are anything more than a medium sized person, the seats are narrow and uncomfortable. Surprisingly, the leg room was reasonable for economy. The crew were great; efficient, polite and pleasant, in particular Korean flight attendants. The food was the usual minuscule portion but there is an impressive selection of things that you can buy on board for reasonable prices. Unfortunately, most things were ""out of stock"" as the phrase goes in Malaysia as they had run out on the flight over from KL. All I can say is that it's an uncomfortable flight made easier by nice crew. The flight was 5.5 hours in duration and any longer and it would have been unbearable. The toilets were dirty and the sink was clogged and that didn't change throughout the flight. Although this was the quiet zone, the premium cabin in front had a crying baby which pretty much destroyed the atmosphere of the quiet zone."
"""recommend AirAsia X""",9,10,2016-12-06,,"✅ Verified Review |  Kuala Lumpur to Sydney return. Great for budget-minded travelers, but the seats could get a little uncomfortable for long-haul flights. The crew was amazing and the take-off/landing was smooth. We managed to make it to the destinations earlier than scheduled without delay (which is a surprise!), so no complaints there. Would certainly recommend AirAsia X for the KUL-SYD and return routes."
"""another great flight""",10,10,2016-12-04,,"✅ Verified Review |  Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo Haneda. Another great flight with AirAsia, this time with AirAsia X their long haul company and it was fantastic, I could not recommend it enough, low fare, great onboard service. I would recommend booking a seat at the rear of the aircraft if you're a couple as the configuration in economy thins from 3x3x3 to 2x3x2 and I was very happy here."
"""great value for money""",10,10,2016-12-04,,"My wife and I flew Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur with Air Asia X on an Airbus A330. We were in Premier Flex which includes what is called a hot seat in the front row of the child free quiet zone, priority check in, boarding and exiting, 20kg baggage, one hot meal and a bottle of water. Any thing else you pay for. Left and arrived on time, crew fine. Great value for money."
"""recommended for shorter flights""",7,10,2016-12-03,,"✅ Verified Review | Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo Haneda with AirAsia X. Price for air ticket alone is fair enough but not until you add on luggage and meals. Legroom is perfect, while seat width is unbearable for a 6 hours+ flight unless there is a empty seat beside you. KL to Haneda plane is showing sign of ageing and cleanliness of cabin and lavatory is terrible. However, flight from Haneda to KL is superb (on-time and clean, with attentive FA). Onboard purchase for food and snack with good and reasonable pricing. Overall, recommended for flight shorter than 6 hours / not midnight flight."
"""food was a very small portion""",8,10,2016-12-01,,"✅ Verified Review | Kuala Lumpur to Perth with AirAsia X. Midnight departure and the boarding gate was crowded and cramped, managed by a solitary attendant. The PA system was scratchy and he could hardly be understood. Boarding was not organised. On board, attendants were efficient but not overtly friendly. They were a bit slow in giving out blankets but once done, the lights were switched off and the whole cabin was horizontal. Announcements on the plane were awful, especially the safety announcement. The flight attendant spoke fast and her words were not clear. There was only one attendant displaying the safety procedures in the business cabin and I could hardly see him from the other side of the aircraft where I was seated. They seemed rushed in everything that they did, or were they trying to be efficient? The food was a very small portion of coconut rice and spicy sambal (nasi lemak) which was gone in five spoonfuls. Not worth the money for that tiny meal. The rest of the flight was uneventful."
"""not happy with this flight""",4,10,2016-11-24,,✅ Verified Review |  I was on AirAsia X flight from Seoul to Kuala Lumpur. The flight duration was 6 hours plus and the cabin was warm. I was seated at quiet zone window seat 8K and had to endure the warmth. Informed the air stewardess to check the air conditioner and she replied would check with captain but she never returned nor the condition had improved.  The seat and leg room are narrow and designed not for comfort. Food quality dropped too. The Pak Nasser nasi lemak is not fresh and tasted salty.  Not happy with this flight.
"""definitely fly them again""",7,10,2016-11-11,,"✅ Verified Review |  Melbourne to Manila return via Kuala Lumpur, booked for Manila Clark but close the route earlier this year. Good flight in all outbound both left on time, return both sector slightly delayed, seats are ok, food was to be honest very tasty for my taste and service was better for those who book in advance. KLIA2 is a fantastic terminal find it hard to believe it is a low cost One. Only downside really was the Red lounge of AirAsia, the experience was horrible, on arrival no food available no selection of drinks, food only came out after staff notice there are people coming in. The  only good side is it only cost me 29AUD but would not use in future, instead will try the other lounges. In all what you pay is what you get, will definitely fly them again."
"""very nice Flight Attendants""",10,10,2016-11-06,,"✅ Verified Review |  Tokyo Haneda to Kuala Lumpur with AirAsia X. The flight was delayed by 15 mins but it has a great service, very nice Flight Attendants. The flight was almost full and I was seated at row 42A, the food was delicious.

"""service has always been good""",8,10,2016-10-27,,"✅ Verified Review | Kuala Lumpur to Sydney with AirAsia X. I have flown many times between Australia and Malaysia with AirAsia (In fact, more than 15 times return over the last 8 years). I have enjoyed it most of the time. I am not expecting 5 star services from a budget airline but the service has always been good. Flight prices can be really cheap if you book early. There is no free entertainment provided during the flight. But it does not bother as I mostly sleep through my flights anyway. Food prices are very reasonable (~5AUD) and tasty (Nasi lemak is my favourite). It is definitely worth to book your meals before checking in."
"""complaint without any feedback""",1,10,2016-10-08,,"Sydney to Phnom Penh via Kuala Lumpur. We had flown AirAsia X in the past with no issues, but this time we had problems from day one. AirAsia X had changed our flight without communicating it to us. They had changed it as the second leg of the flight was cancelled. If they had spoken to us, we would have taken the normal flight and the later flight out of KL the next day. We already had accommodation book. By AirAsia changing the flight we would had reached our destination a day late to meet our itinerary. It is now 40 days since we lodged a refund / complaint without any feedback. How can a business run like this."
"""legroom better than some legacy carriers""",7,10,2016-08-15,,"Kuala Lumpur to Taipei. Overall, a good product. Both flights left on time and landed ahead of schedule. Frequent announcements and updates from the cockpit. Seats are OK, surprisingly legroom was better than some legacy carriers. Cabin crew was generally nice and smiling, but looked quite tired on the return leg. Planes new, but leather seats on the return flight looked worn-out. The tickets were incredibly cheap. Would fly again but not on flights longer than 5-6 hours as you need to pay for everything onboard and, of course, there is no IFE."
"""efficient and no-nonsense""",7,10,2016-08-10,,"✅ Verified Review |  Flying Sydney to Delhi, the shortest route is the non-stop service by Air India totaling about 13 hours at a little more than AUD 3,500 per passenger. Air Asia X was the next best route with 14.5 hours inclusive of the stopover in KUL and compared to Air India was offering a price of AUD 1463 per passenger in its Premium Flatbed. Air Asia X departs at a convenient 10.55 am from Sydney and post transit through Kuala Lumpur arrives into New Delhi by 10.00 pm. It was suitable for us as we had enough time to have breakfast at our hotel next to Sydney Airport and allowed us to rest or read through most of our flight. Entitlements: Booking with Premium Flatbed, offers the opportunity to, grab your preferred seat at no extra cost, checked luggage entitlement of 40kg and select one complimentary meal with a bottle of mineral water. Check-In: Dedicated lane is available for passengers travelling in Premium Flatbed. Since Australia requires one to have a Boarding Pass issued by the airline, there is no option to pre-print a boarding pass. Staff at check-in are efficient, however there was one gentleman who bothered us by asking us multiple times if we were travelling Premium Flatbed. There were only 2 Air Asia flights at that time with just 5 passengers in Premium Flatbed. How difficult is it to remember faces? Luggage was checked-in all the way through to New Delhi and we carried one small suitcase and two bags on board. Air Asia X as a part of its service design does not offer a lounge. Boarding: SYD had a dedicated lane for Premium Flatbed passengers. This is where the gentleman we met at check-in decided to ask us again if we were Premium Flatbed passengers. Air Asia X operates out of the Low Cost Carrier Terminal KLIA 2 at Kuala Lumpur. At KUL we were required to clear security twice, at the Transit Point and then just as we entered the access-way to the gates. Do look out for the gate numbers carefully as they are not in serial order as one might expect. You are required to wait at the boarding gate until the Air Asia X staff verify your Boarding Pass and Passport, prior to letting you into the Gate Area. Boarding in KUL is chaotic at best. In spite of being the base of operations for Air Asia X, there is no dedicated lane for boarding of Premium Flatbed and no announcements are made. On-board: Efficient and no-nonsense unless you want to purchase food and beverages on board. Blankets and pillows are placed on the seat as passengers arrive, along with a bottle of water. There is ample luggage space in the overhead bins. Post take-off, they offer to serve the pre-booked meal in 20 minutes or whenever the passenger finds it convenient. We flipped through the onboard menu and ordered Sparkling Wine. They accept foreign currency, however any balance amount would be paid back only in Malaysian Ringgit and since that was quite cumbersome, we decided to charge to our Credit Card. A minimum order of 30MYR is required for payment by Credit Card. The pre-booked meals were served hot and were promptly cleared and window shades pulled down. The in-flight entertainment system has to be pre-booked and is quite basic. Recommend loading your tablet or computer with entertainment. An international charging point is available at each seat. Arrival: At KUL, the aero-bridge was attached to the middle of the aircraft, hence no priority exit for Premium Flatbed, which wasn't the case in DEL. Baggage arrived promptly at DEL and we were out within an hour of arrival."
"""I was very impressed""",8,10,2016-07-17,,✅ Verified Review |  I travelled with my family from Sydney to Yangon via Kuala Lumpur and return with AirAsia X. The SYD-KUL legs were on an A330 while the KUL-RGN legs were on an A320. This was our first time on AirAsia and it was primarily due to the substantial cost saving. Although I travel extensively (around 20 international trips per year) for work I generally do not fly low cost carriers. Our experience with AirAsia was very interesting to me. We had four sectors and all sectors were serviced by good aircraft. All four sectors work perfectly on time and the cabin crew were very good. You do need to buy food and a beer but after saving approximately $2000 on the airfares I was not too concerned about this. There is no in-flight entertainment but even on premium airlines I invariably use my own iPad in any event. We were able to check our luggage all the way from Sydney to Yangon via the new terminal in Kuala Lumpur which is not always possible on low-cost carriers. All in all (although my expectations were modest) I was very impressed by the overall level and quality of service.
"""it is a reliable airline""",10,10,2016-07-05,,"✅ Verified Review |  We've used AirAsia X many times as it is a reliable airline, offering standardised service. Flew from Kuala Lumpur to Perth. We book in the quiet zone. For just a little extra cost, we've always had the seat between us for free, so actually it works out a great price for what we get, it offers much better quietness and comfort than full service airlines. Usually we check in one large piece of luggage between us and take on hand luggage each. That works well. My partner needs a wheelchair in some of the larger airports. That has usually worked out well. We buy a couple of packs each of the chicken satay online, and take some salad and fruit onboard. That makes a better meal that many of the full service airlines offer."
"""the flight was fantastic""",9,10,2016-06-11,,"I have just returned from Bali flying AirAsia X direct from Sydney, the flight was fantastic, cabin was clean, service for a LCC was brilliant the crew the so kind to us, pre booked meals were delicious and other menu items priced well. It's such a shame they are stopping Sydney to Bali flights soon, I would have continued to use them if not. Thanks AirAsia for a great trip"
"""highly recommend""",9,10,2016-05-20,,"✅ Verified Review | Late night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne with AirAsia X in Premium class. For this ticket, you get 40 kgs luggage allowance and one free meal. On boarding, they ask you if you would like your meal after take off or just before arrival. This was a nice touch as the flight left at 1030pm so you could go straight to sleep and to have breakfast before landing. FAs were pleasant and accommodating at all times. They give you a large pillow and a comfy duvet for sleep. The premium seat is angled flat which was actually very comfortable and wide, and I am a big guy. I would highly recommend this airline for their premium class product. My only negative observation was that the plane looked a little dated."
"""I got what I paid for""",7,10,2016-05-07,,"Flew AirAsia X in March from Auckland via Gold Coast to Kuala Lumpur in Economy with confirmed Optiontown 3 seats. Worth the extra NZ$65 to get a whole row to myself. Also went with the flexible ticket which gave me premium check in at Auckland. On the return I flew Bali to Sydney in Premium Flatbed which was not flat and I found myself slipping down so my feet supported my body. Quite comfortable nevertheless. Overall, I got what I paid for although despite having a prebooked meal on the AKL to OOL sector it wasn't available and I had to have something else - not best pleased with the alternative offered. Ground services in AKL and in DPS were both good with friendly check in."
"""Quiet Zone was again a boon""",7,10,2016-04-20,,"✅ Verified Review |  AirAsia X recently began service from Kuala Lumpur to Auckland. We booked two tickets on the launch fare of MYR 998 return and after adding the checked in luggage, seats in the Quiet Zone as well as meals, the tickets came up to just under MYR 1,500 per person, roughly half the cost of a ticket on an Emirates flight via Melbourne. The outbound flight departed and arrived on schedule. Check in at KLIA2 was swift as we were there about 3 hours before departure. Transit at Gold Coast Airport was about 3 hours, and it was quite tolerable. We had to go through another security screening before we are allowed into the transit area. On arrival in Auckland, the checked in luggage was delivered without any undue delay. Inflight service was the usual AirAsia X standard and we appreciated the Quiet Zone as we do not have to endure crying babies, etc. There were two meal service runs on the flight to Gold Coast and a single run on the flight from Gold Coast to Auckland. On landing in Auckland, the aircraft parked at a remote bay and we boarded a bus to the terminal. The return flight from Auckland was not as smooth. Check in at Auckland Airport was very slow due to unfamiliarity of operations by the check in counter staff. Many passengers were stuck at the counter for more than 15 minutes when it should take no more than 5 minutes. Our check in process took about one hour and 15 minutes - we were there well before the check in counters opened. AirAsia X should closely examine the performance of their Auckland Airport service agents. Transit at Gold Coast Airport was only 1 hour this time and we re-boarded the aircraft soon after we cleared security! This time, seperate boarding queues was implemented to segregate transit passengers from those who were joining the flight to Kuala Lumpur from Gold Coast. Inflight service was similar to the outbound flight except that there was only one meal service from Gold Coast to Kuala Lumpur. The Quiet Zone was again a boon. However, on the Auckland to Gold Coast sector, a passenger managed to sneak into this cabin and proceeded to chat with his friend throughout the three hour flight. A little annoying that the cabin crew did not pick up this passenger who upgraded himself from the back of the plane! In summary, the new AirAsia X Auckland service is welcome and the flights were full. I am not sure if I will fly this route again if the airfare was not at least 50% cheaper than the nearest competitive fare. The transit at Gold Coast Airport has added to journey time and inconvenience. I would need an attractive incentive to use this service again."
"""good value for money""",8,10,2016-04-16,,"We flew Perth-Kuala Lumpur and return on Air Asia X. Good flights both ways, we paid a little extra to sit in the quiet zone up the front and it was worth it as many of the seats were empty and this gave us a little more room. It surprised me that they made me turn off the music on my phone for takeoff, as many airlines have moved to a policy where electronic devices are able to on for duration of flight. On the return flight the crew did not have an issue with this. Flights departed on time and overall we were happy and good value for money compared to full service carrier on this route."
"""service of a great airline""",9,10,2016-04-11,,"✅ Verified Review |  Beijing to Bali via Kuala Lumpur. AirAsia X is a low cost airline with the service of a great airline! I recommend that you book economy, then later go to optiontown.com and try and upgrade to premium flatbed. We did this, but did not get flatbed. The airline, as compensation, granted everyone the ESO option, which was better than flatbed. It gave everyone a block of seats (3) to themselves, granting a comfortable flight. The transit in Kuala Lumpur was easy, and staff were happy to help us. On the shorter flight, we bought food, which was very delicious and well priced. Everyone was great. I am taking one point off because, in the pocket of my seat, there was a brochure for renting a tablet to watch movies inflight, which I hadn't heard about before. When I asked the cabin attendant if I could rent one, she said that those were only available on flights to/from Australia. My question is why have a brochure for this on a plane to China? Overall, I would definitely recommend flying AirAsia again, especially because they were a third of the price compared to Garuda and Air China."
"""more than a low cost company""",9,10,2016-03-27,,"Kuala Lumpur to Taipei, and AirAsia X in my opinion is more than a low cost company. This time I book the business class as it is still cheap. I had great problems to get my ticket by mail. I got 2 chats with AirAsia : have to wait around 30 minutes each time. I was not able to get my ticket. But at Kuala Lumpur airport they have printed it without any problem. We wera only 3 in the fisrt class. The seat is really good : you can totally lie and have a good rest. The service is simple but enough (no wine ). It was a good flight, and I recommend this experience."
"""a very pleasant experience""",9,10,2016-03-02,,AirAsia X from Sydney to Denpasar. Seat 42C. Flight departed on time from Sydney and about 75% full. Efficient service onboard. Food and drink was offered after take off and again about 2 hours from destination. Cabin crew prompt to answer call bell and attend to requests. Cabin and toilets clean. Seat comfortable and decent amount of legroom. Food tasty (chicken satay - smallish but reasonably priced). Ran out of alcohol about two hours into flight. Communication from flight deck and purser informative and detailed through out flight. Landed into Denpassar on time. Flight time 6hrs exactly. Cleared formalities at Denpassar in about 15 minutes (from gate to arrival hall). Overall a very pleasant experience and I would definitely fly AirAsia X again
"""great full red-eye flight""",9,10,2016-02-27,,"A great full red-eye flight from Kuala Lumpur to Chitose on 25/2/16. Passengers mostly were from transit and the rear seat at 45-51A and C is really comfortable with good seat pitch, inflight food is medium term. The highlight is 2 Japanese FAs provided excellent service. It was a pleasure and convenient journey to have a direct flight from regional area ."
"""FA's are attentive""",10,10,2016-02-21,,"We have travelled several times with AirAsia X from Kuala Lumpur - Gold Coast return and have no issues with the airline, only compliments on the opportunity to travel at a lower price than other airlines. We know its a Low cost carrier and you have to pay for extras, luggage, meals, drinks, entertainment, blankets, but if you pre-book and follow clearly visible instruction on their web site you can save money to be spent on your holiday. Our flight on 19th February left 20 minutes late due to 2 people not boarding and their luggage needing to be removed, all this information was announced by the captain and we still arrived on the Gold Coast 5 minutes early. We pre-paid with Optiontown ($60) to have 3 seats together per person, this is a lottery and you receive confirmation 3 days prior to the flight, we were lucky and this helped us sleep as this was a night flight (we have previously received an upgrade to flatbed using Optiontown). FA's are attentive with a good command of English. Serving of pre-booked meals is first then you are able to order food and drink the cost of a meal approx. $5, bottled water $1.50 they do take most currency but change is give in Malaysian Ringget. Seat were comfortable, able to recycle, adjustable headrest, inflight magazine, small pocket space. They clearly have a product that appeals to many age groups and cultures, research their web site, follow the instruction and pre-book items you will enjoy the flight and have some extra spending money, I will be flying with AirAsia X and their partner airlines again."
"""is cheap and efficient""",8,10,2016-02-16,,"I've flown AirAsia X many times and never had anything bad happen, except possibly a slightly delayed flight. It is cheap and efficient. You have to pay for everything like food or entertainment. But for the amount of money you save it's fine. Staff have always been friendly. Decor inside plane is pleasant. Food, particularly inter-Asia is generally quite good, especially considering it only costs $4 a meal."
"""luggage didn't arrive""",4,10,2016-02-10,,"AirAsia X Premium flatbed Perth to Bangkok via Kuala Lumpur and again problems.  As PER to KUL was late leaving, when in KUL I asked if the luggage would make the connection, all of their assurances that it would obviously meant nothing, as I was the only one left standing by the luggage carousel at Bangkok Don Muang waiting for luggage that wasn’t going to arrive. 10 hours later (after 1am) it arrived at my hotel. But not only did it miss the connection, one of the wheels of my case was broken. "
"""experience was okay""",7,10,2016-01-20,,"Kuala Lumpur to Sydney and my first time to fly with AirAsia X, and the business class is quite affordable at time of booking. It was a pleasant experience using a flatbed for 8 hour trip. Food and entertainment can be purchased before flight. Attendants are pretty busy during this trip and in and out of the area can be disturbing at times. There were only 12 seats in the section so it was not cramped. A free pillow and duvet is a bonus. Overall experience was okay."
"""seats were fantastic""",9,10,2016-01-06,,"Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne. While I have flown with AirAsia X multiple times, this was my first time using their Premium Flatbed (Business Class). Check-In at KLIA2 was a breeze as there is a dedicated line to Premium Flatbed passengers, Premium passengers are also first to board and depart the plane. Flight was on time to depart and land. The seats were fantastic, as the name suggests the seat turns into a flatbed with the touch of a button. I was able to sleep for the entire duration of my red eye flight to Melbourne which made the trip well worth the price and seeing the price for my business seat was the same price as a seat on a full service economy flight, I'll definitely be using this service in the future."
"""cabin staff are friendly""",8,10,2015-12-11,,"This is my fourth flight on this route (PNH to SYD via KUL) with AirAsia X this year. I am amazed as to how consistently good the service is with what is supposed to be a low-cost airline. The cabin staff are friendly and professional. I did not pre-order any meals on the PNH-KUL or KUL-SYD sectors because I was able to have dinner in the KLIA2 transit area. The flights took off on time and landed either early or on time. For the AirAsia X flight, I especially recommend the Quiet Zone. It is really worth it. During my 2nd flight this year, I had to have an overnight transit in KUL on the way back from SYD because of a flight cancellation. AirAsia took care of everything reasonably efficiently."
"""but still no response""",3,10,2015-11-30,,"I have used AirAsia in the past and been totally satisfied. However they have just amended a booking I had Colombo-KL from AirAsia X widebody daytime flight, to AirAsia overnight flight. They offered only a date change or a credit with 90 day validity. In my view a change of equipment, day to night, and carrier merits a refund. All attempts to contact receive a standard response saying they will examine within 48 hours. But this case is now nearly a month old. I have requested a credit, but still no response. Fly with them in the knowledge of the possibility this may occur."
"""I got what I paid for""",6,10,2015-11-13,,"I traveled from Bangalore to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur in October this year by AirAsia and AirAsia X.  The booking experience was fine. Had already registered on their website for a domestic flight earlier. While planning my trip researched on Internet and found out they had this sale where Tickets were priced less than half of Others. Without a second thought booked two for me and my wife. While booking came to know that Checked in baggage and meals need a Surcharge. But even then two tickets cost me Rs 70000 for return with 1 checked in baggage and 4 Meals which was Super Value. I had to pay for seat selection with my wife while web checkin or if I wanted extra leg space. The flights arrived and departed on schedule, flights were clean, Flight attendants were properly dressed and spoke English.  Food served was average and I discovered I had to pay more in Indian rupees while pre-booking while it cost less in Malaysian currency inflight. Toilets were clean. AirAsia X flight from KUL to MEL was a widebody jet. There was no entertainment system. Seats were tight for me (6 feet) but my wife (5/6) was alright. Had 7 and 5 hours lay over at KLIA terminal 2 at Kuala Lumpur which is fine for Shopping  and Eating and even has a low cost Samasama hotel where we rested for few hours. Overall I got what I paid for. I recommend planning and booking in advance to book in their frequent sales and making most of it."
"""crew were prompt and polite""",6,10,2015-10-26,,Kuala Lumpur to Kathmandu on AirAsia X. Friendly cabin crew were prompt and polite. Calls were responded well and with a smile. Overall a normal AirAsia X flight except that we had to wait 1.5 hrs to receive our bags at Kathmandu airport. My only issue was with the AirAsia X staff at the oversize baggage counter who refused to put on a fragile sticker on my luggage insisting it was not her job to do so and she did it in a very arrogant manner.
"""for the price paid it was brilliant""",10,10,2015-09-17,,"We were originally booked on the AirAsia X Adelaide to Kuala Lumpur service. That route was cancelled and we were offered Melbourne to Kuala Lupmur instead. AirAsia X paid to get us to Melbourne the night before, ready for an early morning departure. We had booked seats in the economy quiet zone. That is wonderful. It costs $22 extra for 8 hours of peace and quiet. It is rarely full, as being a budget airline, most customers prefer to take their chances in the back cabin. So we had the seat between us free, or could sleep on a row of 3 seats. That wasn't the case in the back cabin. So we got incredible value for our money. We had booked one bag between us and took onboard the usual cabin luggage.  We booked 2 meals each, and took a bag of fruit and salad to supplement it. The chicken sate meal is perfect. There is a good magazine in the seat pocket. Enough to keep you reading a couple hours. You can pay for a tablet rental, or bring your own if you want videos. The flight took off and arrived a bit late, but luggage arrived quickly, so we were out of the airport at the other end as planned. All in all, for the price paid it was brilliant!"
AirAsia X customer review,2,10,2015-08-11,,"Not a bad airline as long as nothing goes wrong. However if your baggage goes missing or your plane breaks down and you consequently miss your connection due to a 4 hour delay, you are on your own. Do not expect any assistance whatsoever. I have contacted the airline directly concerning this matter and this was their reply, ""Please be informed that AirAsia is point-to-point carrier and does not encourage connecting flights and same condition with your check-in baggage."" As a result, if you must catch connecting flights, I would not recommend AirAsia."
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2015-08-02,,"Very smooth flight. Food pretty good for a low cost carrier. The usual comfortable but not quite flat AAX Business class. Most acceptable for the price. Attentive flight attendants, with a sense of humour. The early morning coffee (for a small charge) is an improvement. Two issues. I have problems seeing why we checked in online. It doesn't seem to speed things up. Our Business class check in was extremely slow. AAX should have a look at the system used by Hong Kong Express, also a low budget carrier. If you fly from KLIA2, be aware that it is a looong walk to the departure gates. It woild be easy to miss planes by assuming they were the usual distance from Customs and Security check points."
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2015-07-24,,"Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo Haneda. A full flight with mostly Japanese passengers, delay for 30 minutes but managed to arrive on schedule. Meal is ok and limited legspace, but bring your entertainment devices to keep up the time. Great choices as HND is near city. I noticed that seat 45A onwards the cabin is hot."
AirAsia X customer review,6,10,2015-07-24,,"Flew Kuala Lumpur to Chengdu D7326 (Gate Q14-KLIA2).  Completely full flight with mostly Chinese travellers. Seat 46G, overall a normal flight with satisfactory product offer. Arrive on-time and meal is just ok."
AirAsia X customer review,4,10,2015-06-11,,"Flew from Gold Coast (OOL) to Kuala Lumpur (KUL) on the 13th May 2015. I had booked a flight from Sydney to KL, but the flight was cancelled a month prior to departure with no explanation given. They shifted me to a flight that would have left me stranded in Kuala Lumpur, unable to catch my connecting flight to Europe. However, they
did offer me a full refund, which was processed quickly and efficiently. As I was based in northern New South Wales at the time, I booked a flight from Gold Coast instead. The online check-in was quick, however I was placed in a middle seat. On board the plane, let's just say I was lucky enough to have some pretty powerful sleeping pills. The Economy seating on the A330 was cramped and narrow - something which you don't want when you're 6'1"" tall. Additionally, you have to pay for entertainment - something you don't usually expect on a 9-hour flight. The cabin crew could not make themselves clearly understood either. I will say a few good things about the airline, though. I had ordered a nasi lemak when I booked the flight - this is unbelievably delicious and thoroughly recommended. Also, AirAsia X is incredibly good value for money. In conclusion, I would recommend AirAsia X, so long as you have patience and the gumption to pre-order food."
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2015-05-20,,D7 212 KUL-MEL. Check-in at KLIA2 is very efficient. Boarded on time but a technical fault with the APU resulted in a 45 minute delay. Once underway the meal service was slightly chaotic though everyone did get their pre- booked meals in a reasonable time. Cabin crew appeared slightly flustered for a lot of the time. Crew friendly and helpful though. Seats are undeniably narrow (16.5 inches) but seat pitch no worse than most at 32 inches (and 2 inches better than Jetstar's Dreamliner). Definitely recommend paying the bit extra for a 'hot seat' with extra legroom (I had 17C). The Quiet Zone seats are rubbish.. Same seating as further back and whilst there are no children in this forward cabin there are still plenty of loud adults. Much better to select a bulkhead hotseat and stretch out there. Overall a reasonable flight at a fantastic price!
AirAsia X customer review,5,10,2015-04-28,,I flew to Melbourne from Bali with Air Asia Indonesia X on 21 March 2015. This price included 20 kg of checked in luggage a meal and a small bottle of water. AA ground staff and software need to be improved. When I boarded the plane I found a man sitting in my seat. I showed him my boarding pass and he showed me that he also had a boarding pass for the same seat! I waved to the flight attendant and she came over and told me to wait. After five minutes she returned with a passenger list and sent the man to another seat. There is no entertainment available on an Air Asia Indonesia X Airbus A330 plane. Seat width and legroom are also tight. As the flight was only one third full many passengers were able to sleep spread out over three seats. The Air Asia Indonesia X plane left on time and arrived punctually in Melbourne. Overall I prefer to fly in a Jetstar Boeing Dreamliner rather than an Asia Indonesia X Airbus A330.
AirAsia X customer review,5,10,2015-03-30,,Flew SYD-KUL 7/3 quiet zone and Business return on 23/3. You pay for what you get but compared to 6/12 months ago no choice in drink selection or snacks and prices have increased dramatically. Business class toilet had toilet rolls as tissues soap dispenser leaked and staff could not fix it. Suddenly it appeared that supplies were limited or restricted by the suppliers? No lounge at KLIA2 (being repaired). The full service MAS is appearing more attractive now as prices are becoming closer.
AirAsia X customer review,3,10,2015-03-23,,I travel quite frequently between PER and KUL and in last six months on several trips I have been moved to other flights causing much disruptions/inconvenience to planned bus/train connections. I have a trip coming up in about four weeks and discovered (through manage by bookings) that they have moved me to other flights again. They have not even notified me by email/sms.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2015-03-17,,Flew from Incheon to Melbourne return via KL. Overall I was satisfied with this airline for the price I paid although by the time you pay for the extras you want you don't end up saving that much compared to a full service airline. All the flights were on schedule or ahead of schedule. The staff were all efficient professional and friendly. The cabin on the last leg of the journey felt very cold and so I had to pay to rent a blanket. The flights were smooth and I was pleased to get updates from the pilot about our flight - you don't get this with Chinese airlines. The meals that I pre-purchased were tasty but don't bother with the 'maximize you meal' stuff it's just a bit of sugary rubbish. The transfers at the new KLIA2 airport were smooth and the terminal there is very good.
AirAsia X customer review,1,10,2015-03-04,,I was one of the unfortunate ones whose flights to and from Adelaide were cancelled. Had proper consideration and care been given to customers and appropriate alternate arrangements been made I would have had no cause for complaint. However this was not the case. The re-routing process was a nightmare. Only my partner was re-routed to Melbourne for our return flight while I had to resubmit the request after a few days. Upon checking in at Melbourne airport we were advised that our KL to Penang sector was on different flights and were told to go to the transfer desk at KLIA2. First their customer service centre denied receiving my emails even though I was showing them to the lady at the transfer counter. Then after a few enquiries they said they had not changed my KL- Penang flight because the earlier flight I had requested had only one remaining space left which my partner was transferred into. They apparently did not think it was important to notify us of this to allow sufficient time to make other arrangements. I was told that my flight was full too so he couldn't come on mine on boarding I noticed an empty spot right next to me and another one across the aisle. We arrived in Penang 2.5 hours apart. Not only did I have to pay an additional 300AUD per person for my trip it took me more than twice the length of time it usually takes me on MAS. Flights were on time and thankfully we reached Penang safely. But service was non existent. Hoping the return journey will be less distressing.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2015-02-24,,My family and I flew from KUL-KUL-NGO. My journey was good although the distance between the seat and the seat should be repaired because of my long legs that required a long distance between seats. AirAsia X is an airline that serve long haul cheap flight so the so the comfort is important although the price itself it is so cheap. For the magnitude of the seat must be enlarged again and replace the seat base material because it does not taste good. My family and I had to scramble a comfortable place because our shoulders is always touching each other. For the food enough and tasty although it must be paid separately from our ticket. For a low-cost airline is all worth it.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2015-02-11,,21st Jan D7237 and 26 Jan D7 232. Flew last week from Perth to KL and back this airline is excellent for a low cost airline. Ground crew and flight crew were very professional. Was a pleasant flight will always fly with AirAsia and AirAsia X.
AirAsia X customer review,5,10,2015-01-26,,A very poor experience with AirAsia X as this airline is apparently severely let down by their ground operations. I'm 6 foot 7 and require extra leg room to safely make it to the other side. With AirAsia X this requires me to spend some money on an extra leg room seat such is their business model. I have no issues with this and thus spent an extra $100 or so in total but during check in my extra leg room seat was not available. Turns out that you lose your seat preference when you re-schedule your booking online which I did. The online system doesn't notify you of this. If you make a phone call and change your flight dates that way they will actually transfer the seat preference to the new booking but do it online and you'll lose it. This seems like a flaw in their operations. Ground staff offered me an emergency exit row to compensate but this was a middle seat and not in the 'quiet zone' which I had booked. A little annoyed because I wasn't getting what I paid for but at least I had the required extra leg room. When entering the flight (8 hours KLIA-MEL) I was astonished to find out that they had in actual fact given me a middle seat in a normal row and it came down to the cabin crew (who were excellent!) to sort it out short notice. In the end I got the bulkhead seat in the quiet zone which I had selected. I think ground staff might have been looking at a different seat map altogether. All in all a poor experience.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2015-01-19,,Took a flight from KUL-HND HND-KUL in November 2014. The take off and touchdown were smooth. The cabin crews were also very helpful. There was an old man sitting next to me and he received the wrong meal order but the cabin crews responded very quickly and helped him. The meals were also delicious! Though there were not much in-flight entertainment I couldn't ask for more as I couldn't find any budget airlines that is as good as AirAsia X.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2015-01-19,,I recently travelled with Air Asia X from Sydney to KL return. Both flights I was meet with bubbly and friendly flight attendants. Whilst on board the service continued with great food. The plane was clean and very spacious for a low cost airline. I also travelled with a bike on this journey with some airlines this can prove to be a bit of a painful task however this process was swift and handled better than some high class airlines in Australia. Coming home from KL I decided to ride in the quiet zone this is such a great idea and was met with all thumbs up from me as I was able to enjoy a lengthy nap on the red eye flight! Overall a great airline can't wait to head back over to Malaysia with Air Asia X in the future.
AirAsia X customer review,1,10,2015-01-11,,"KIX-KUL-KIX. Booked in Jan 2014. In Dec 2014 AirAsia cancelled our return flight for ""commercial reasons"" (strange: Jan 4th is possibly the busiest day of the year for travel in Japan). We had to come back 2.5 days earlier losing our preferred seat in the process. Both flights on time. Boarding in KUL chaotic - one man checking boarding passes manually at gate P5 - causing queue of passengers in corridor just to get into the waiting area near the gate. Food poor (I think it has got worse) announcements far too loud and frequent. Immigration in KL (klia2) pretty quick baggage claim a bit slow."
AirAsia X customer review,5,10,2014-12-29,,The start to the trip was not very good poor service at the airport and lack of direction from staff. I guess that's what Air Asia gets for outsourcing their customer service on ground. Plane image looks like its been patched up. Food selection is getting boring. It would be best to bring your own food because if you have flown them before its the same old food. They could at least bring out one different dish on the menu which you can pre order but its all the same. Flight was fully booked so packed like sardines. Flight left 20 minutes late. Comparing the flight with last time it would appear Air Asia X have let their services go and its now going down hill as Malaysia Airlines becomes more competitive.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2014-12-18,,I fly AAX open jaw on the KUL-PER and MEL-KUL routes. Business class is a couple hundred dollars more than full service airlines but I get the chance to buy up to 40 kg of sporting goods extra baggage for a paltry amount (as compared to full-service airlines. I don't need the excessive amounts of food and drink served on regular Business class full-service flights. Mind you I miss the lounge access now that the Red carpet service has ended in KUL.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2014-12-01,,14th Nov Gold Cast to Kuala Lumpur D7 207. 16th Nov Kuala Lumpur to Gold Coast D7 202. I enjoyed my flight from Kuala Lumpur to Gold Coast. The flight was very smooth and the cabin crew provided excellent service. I will definitely be flying AirAsiaX again.
AirAsia X customer review,1,10,2014-12-01,,Outward November 7 D7246 from KL to Adelaide. Return Nov 17 D7247 from Adelaide to KL. The difference between low-cost and full-service airlines is in the was they handle failure. For AAX the way they handle it is - badly. Both our outward and return flights cancelled and re-booked - we were advised this my SMS at 22.45 on a Friday night! It took 4 calls at my own expense to fix it. One of the Premium flatbeds had no power to it so not even the 2 inches of recline you get in economy. Staff said they would fix it - but didn't - nor did they have the courtesy to tell us it wasn't going to be fixed - they simply disappeared off and forgot about us. This was booked as Premium flatbed it wasn't an Optiontown upgrade. We were asked about this several times so I guess if it had been OT they would have cared even less. Our Optiontown for the return flight was not transferred to the re-booked flight. OT has confirmed the refund but it shows the lack of interest of AAX in customer service - naturally when I mentioned this on check-in and asked about OT upgrades they told me the best they could do was to sell me a business-class ticket at full cost. The 5 people I dealt with at KLIA2 (their hub airport) went out of their way to be difficult avoid giving answers avoid assisting arguing why things couldn't be done to avoid actually doing a d** thing and since they all gave conflicting statements I spent two hours arguing with people between flights and left none the wiser. I have to say the flights were on time and the Premium seats that did work were very good but the hassle that accompanied the trip at all stages and the unprofessional and disinterested attitude of the staff in person on the phone and through their e-forms makes me think it just isn't worth it.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2014-11-20,,On board comfort smooth flying friendly staff and on-time arrival. My recent experience on AirAsia X reached a standard well above the fare that I paid. Well done to the crew and pilot for making my flight a pleasure and one that I will definitely do again.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2014-11-12,,We flew from Adelaide to Kuala Lumpur on 25th October. We've used Air Asia X before so knew what to expect and what to book so as to be comfortable. We booked a long time ahead during a sale period so got our tickets at a very cheap price. For extras we pre-purchased luggage quiet zone seats 2 meals each and a sim card on arrival. The travel insurance offer and local bus transport offer wasn't for us but for others it might be good. The quiet zone economy cabin was about two thirds full so most had an empty seat between 2 people. In the main economy cabin it was full. That's where you'll be put if you don't book a seat - you're not allowed to sit in the quiet zone unless you have booked. So it was money well spent. If you pre-book your meals you will be served what you prefer. If you don't book you will pay more and might not get the full choice. I did a web check-in a few days before the flight. At Adelaide airport all we needed to do was drop in the luggage and we were ready to go. The lines for normal check-in weren't too bad though. You can take food and drink onboard and also take your tablet filled with books and videos. We arrived early into KLIA2. A lot of flights arrive around 4pm KL time. Immigration is quick but there are a lot of people waiting for bags. We were out of the luggage area and into the terminal shopping area in about 40 minutes from arrival. You can collect your sim card in the shopping mall directly in front of you. If you have an early flight the next day as we did the Tune hotel is an easy walk from the terminal. Plenty of shops and restaurants in the terminal to pass the time. All in all for the price we paid it is an excellent deal.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2014-11-03,,I have travelled to Australia Melbourne end of September. I have to say that while I enjoyed the seat in Business class and also the service of the friendly staff there are still some points which could be improved. The inflight offer provides max. 5 films and if one has already seen those then bad luck for you. Same refers to the food which is really honestly rather economy class food in appearance and taste. I am sure that apart from having a comfortable seat they can offer a better service here as well instead of using plastic dishes and food that I would rather not eat.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2014-11-03,,Overall the business class from Beijing (PEK) to Kuala Lumpur (KUL) was fine. The flight attendants were friendly and attentive. The only thing not up to par is the food. The food was indigestible. But I can't really complain when it's only costs $700 USD for business class from PEK to KUL.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2014-11-03,,I always fly Air Asia X from Australia to KL - why pay more for a seat and a bit of food? You still get to the same location for half the price and the service is better then Malaysia Airlines.
AirAsia X customer review,2,10,2014-11-03,,"Air Asia is trying to operate a Business Class service on a budget airline basis and it doesn't work. I was unhappy with the choice and availability of food the lack of TV screens and the insistence on being charged for your drinks except for bottled water which was given out freely. The cabin was spacious and the flat bed an essential. The price charged should have been higher and the service quality that Business Class fliers expect should have been provided. This all palls into insignificance against Air Asia X cancelling my flight that I had paid for 9 months in advance citing ""Commercial Reasons"" for this - in other words they hadn't filled enough seats for the flight so they cancelled it and bundled the passengers on to the next flight. This left me facing an overnight stay in Melbourne airport. Air Asia is doing something nobody else is they are trying to offer low cost Business Class service using the Ryanair model. It doesn't really work and travellers like me would be happy to pay quite a bit more to get the proper level of service. I think they have cut off their nose to spite their face."
AirAsia X customer review,6,10,2014-10-22,,For the HND to KUL route in September 2014. We've also taken this exact flight/route before. Good Value i.e. it was cheap. Otherwise counter service in Japan was horrifically slow more than an hour resulting in a hurried rush through security and immigration to make the plan which is parked at the very most remote gate at the terminal. This was the case as well on the earlier flight. For a long-haul overnight economy seats are just not comfortable enough to sleep. Fortunately in both flights we had an extra seat in our row. There seating is 3-3-3 for an A330 which is one extra seat more than other airlines. Back is very noisy but they do have a quiet area up front of the cabin for a few extra rinngit.
AirAsia X customer review,2,10,2014-10-12,,"ICN-KUL-MEL and signed up for the upgrade through Optiontown. I got all ICN-KUL KUL-MEL sections upgraded to the business class however they did not give out ""confirmation letter"" which confirms that I got upgraded. Instead they sent me ""Pending subject to availability"" letter which was saying that I ""might"" get upgraded so I have to see at the airport. Because of this uncertainty I didn't know what to do with my baggage allowance. I had 30kg of baggage so if I didn't get the upgrade I had to buy the baggage fee online before departure. If I waited until I get to the airport and I didn't get upgraded I would have to pay very expensive weight charge for my baggage. I didn't want to gamble so I just purchased 30kg of allowance online before I go to the airport. I paid $100. I arrived at the airport and checked with the staff at the counter and she told me I'd got upgraded! How annoying! I just wasted $100 for nothing! I don't understand why they give out those uncertain not sure e-mails. If I knew that I was going to be receiving those ambiguous decisions then I wouldn't have signed up for the upgrade."
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2014-10-08,,We took 3 flights in Aug/Sep. SYD-KUL KUL-CMB and KUL-SYD. All the flights were on time. The originally booked KUL-SYD flight was cancelled but we were quickly offered a satisfactory alternative flight on the airline's Chat Line. The airbus 330 and 340 were clean and the much used seats were quite comfortable with generous leg room. Pre-purchased food was generally OK. Alcohol was available and very reasonably priced. Flight attendants were friendly and efficient. Very pleasant experience and extremely good value for money.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2014-10-08,,Flew KL - MEL on 29/9/14 with my family of 8. Check-in was seamless. We were allocated seats near the back of the plane which were fine but a little noisy. Legroom was adequate. Seats were comfortable. Flight left on time. Inflight entertainment we had pre-booked was limited with games and movies particularly for children's entertainment. We had pre-ordered a tablet each and the battery life was inadequate on the tablets and did not last the entire flight. The entertainment was collected 1 hour before landing. I think half an hour would have been fairer. Flight attendants were pleasant but not overly approachable and when I ordered a couple of bottles of water they took at least half an hour for me to get them. We brought our own snacks so didn't order from inflight service. The communication from the pilot during the flight was appropriate. It would have been nice to have a communal screen showing the flight path. Baggage collection was fast at Melbourne airport. Overall I was totally impressed with AirAsiaX and will certainly be flying with them again.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2014-10-08,,PER-KUL-PER. Paid for Flex ticket which included seat choice (including hot seats) and 20 kg checked luggage. If you are bothered by screaming or unsettled children highly recommend the quite zone which is located just behind the Premium class. Seats seem narrower than full service airlines. Meals were efficiently served and cleared and came with a complimentary bottle of water. Can recommend the Nasi Lamak Chicken rice was a bit bland. Something for Air Asia X to consider is stricter enforcement of the 7 kg 1 piece of cabin baggage rule. In KLIA2 many people had many bags and were allowed to bring these onboard. This creates less space for other passengers. KLIA2 is a great airport but expect a long walk if you're arriving or departing from the satellite terminal. Also beware that Air Asia X cancels flights; however they will automatically rebook and allow you to change or cancel if not suitable. Overall this was my first experience flying Air Asia X and I will fly with them on medium hauls again.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2014-10-05,,A good value airline. The flat bed doesn't lie flat but is able to be tweaked into various configurations. Food is OK. If you are elderly or disabled ask the flight attendant to organize a wheelchair/buggy to take you from plane to train/bus/car as KLIA2 is a truly monstrous space some gates being a 40 (forty) minute walk away. You will have to wait for others to disembark but attendant will take you through customs and on to train/bus/exit. This is a free service. I will fly with Air Asia x again.
AirAsia X customer review,2,10,2014-09-28,,"Good one way stranded passengers on the return flight. A330 flight from SYD to KUL return. Aircraft was a refurbished Dragonair plane. Comfortable seating with the Quiet Zone a plus. Purchased inflight entertainment on Samsung Galaxy tab only worked for a few hours of the flight so was not very good value. Purchased food (nasi lemak) was excellent. Flight attendants friendly though a little timid and unsure of themselves. Flight left 20 mins late but made up the time. Return flight was cancelled with only a few days notice leaving passengers stranded and forced to find their own way home. This was a real disappointment. I now feel uncertain purchasing Air Asia tickets will my plane take off or will it be cancelled ""for commercial reasons"" (i.e. there were not enough people on the flight so we just cancelled it)? In the future I will pay a little more for a full service airline that will provide all the food and entertainment for free and will make sure I get to my destination one way or the other. It's worth the extra cost. It is impossible to get the telephone service centre or anyone else at the airline to help you with a problem like this they just don't care."
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2014-09-22,,Travelled SYD to KL on 2 Sep 2014. Usually go to Singapore and Connect to KL but needed the fastest route and this was it. Always travel Business class so did not know what to expect on Air AsiaX. Departed on time new plane clean and modern design. Toilet also very clean and flight attendants were very young and helpful. Seat was quite good and when folded out in to an angled flat bed it was comfortable and you could get some sleep which I needed. Just be aware that the word Business begins and ends with that angled bed no other part of the flight resembles a Business Class flight. This cost me a quarter of what I normally pay and if you work it all out yes it was better value. We arrived in KL on time and the trip was pleasant and smooth - no complaints.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2014-09-14,,We have just flown Gold Coast - Kuala Lumpur (15th August out 7th Sept in) on Air Asia X for the first time and it will not be the last. Both flights left within 10 minutes of schedule check-in and boarding at both airport quick and easy we did arrive 2 hours prior to departure and on both occasions had ample time to find our gate. The seat comfort was superb with pillow and quilt provided as we had been upgraded to business class the pre-booked meal was served when we requested it and the quality was very good with added extras at no charge additional beverages or food during the flight needed to be purchased but at AUD$ 2.00 for a tea/coffee/hot chocolate or soft drink. No IFE but you could purchase the hire of a ipad for AUD $20.00flight attendants were well presented and efficient. Overall we were very impressed with Air Asia X it certainly made for a wonderful start and finish to our holiday's we now need to plan our next one flying Air Asia X.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2014-09-09,,Flight D7 183 CMB to KUL. Got the lucky chance to fly onboard Air Asia's newest aircraft sporting the 'Xcintillating PhoeniX' livery which was just 7 days old at the time of flying CMB to KUL so it was super clean. We were greeted by friendly and enthusiastic flight attendants. The seats were soft and really comfortable. Something that some full service carriers compromise on. This made for a comfortable 3.5 hour journey. The food tasted great and was worth the price considering the cheaper online price. The FAs were very friendly and attentive. They were quick to respond to your needs and more importantly with a smile. Flight D7 182 KUL to CMB. The aircraft was in immaculate condition and once again the service and the FAs were fantastic. Both flights departed bang on time. There is no IFE but it really doesn't matter considering what they have on offer and the good value for money. Overall our experience with Air Asia X was superb and without hesitation give them 5 stars. Would definitely fly with this friendly airline again.
AirAsia X customer review,1,10,2014-09-06,,26 August. Flight D7317 Beijing to Kuala Lumpur then D7182 Kuala Lumpur to Colombo. The Counter staff were efficient and onboard staff spent most of their time sleeping or doing their own thing but the baggage staff were the worst I have experienced in 10 months travelling around Asia. They do not explain anything and basically treat you with contempt if you have an issue. The food was mediocre at best and while a cheap flight it was outweighed by the expenses associated with their poor baggage handling and attitude towards explanations and customer service. Next time I think I will pay the extra and fly with a better quality airline. Budget doesn't mean rude and incompetent.
AirAsia X customer review,,,2014-09-06,,"Will never fly Air Asia again. Premium seats from Australia to KL and KL to Bangkok Thailand were how can I say pathetic! The 1st leg of the flight (Australia to KL) was in the premium flatbed seats which were quite comfy but the service on board was woeful some of the attendants treated us as an annoyance or inconvenience rather than a customer we had to ask 3 times to get the Entertainment tablets Samsung they were not handed to us automatically even though we pre-booked and we got a no answer as to if they were coming after asking for them hence asking 3 times. The flight attendants just left us alone the whole flight never checking if we needed anything or asking if we were OK or needed anything ie drink etc this was very poor customer service indeed. The food was rubbish the selection of movies and TV shows on the tablets was just dismal only a very small amount of movies or TV to choose from very disappointing indeed. Now after paying $4000 (premium seating) to fly you would expect that the 2 hour KL to Bangkok leg would be in a comfy seat as well? Well no is the short answer they use a jet that has no premium seating the seats are tiny I was in agony for 2 hours being crammed into the tiny space they call ""premium seating"" on the KL-Bangkok leg just a complete waste of money."
AirAsia X customer review,5,10,2014-09-01,,Flew MEL-KUL. Premium via airport paid upgrade. The positives: 1. Melbourne check in was pleasant and efficient. 2. Cabin crew pleasant efficient and professional. 3. Premium flatbed seat comfortable. 4. New KLIA2 terminal a vast improvement over LCCT but far too big and poorly designed. The negatives: 1. Had an Optiontown upgrade request for this flight paid for several months ago. Did not get upgraded yet when I went to Air Asia's website there were several premium flatbed seats available for sale after I was denied an upgrade. Was offered an upgrade at the airport for $299 which I took. Why would they promote Optiontown and get us to sign up and pay not allow the upgrade when there are seats available and then sell the upgrades at the airport? Highly unethical business practice. 2. Needed boarding pass reprinted for KUL-DMK connection at KUL when I arrived. The transfer desk had no capability to do this - they instructed me to exit immigration and go to ticket counter or use business centre at airport hotel in terminal. I chose the latter paid $3 for the privilege. This is unacceptable This was after checking in online and having the barcode sent to my phone which Air Asia said was not acceptable. What is the point of checking in online to receive boarding pass electronically if you can't use it? 3. Air Asia's loyalty program is totally worthless. Many many flights lead to no rewards. On balance Air Asia just doesn't get it.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2014-08-28,,SYD-KUL-PVG 23 August 2014. I chose Air Asia X because I wanted a multi-destination itinerary rather than a return flight and the budget airlines (Air Asia to China and Scoot back to Australia) were a much better deal than a legacy airline open-jaw fare. It was a great experience. Check-in at Sydney was quick and easy: the queue was less than 15 minutes and the check-in person was friendly and efficient. Transfer check-in at KLIA2 had no queue at all. I used OptionTown to try to get a row of three seats to myself for the SYD-KUL leg and an upgrade to Business for KUL-PVG. I got both. The row to myself from SYD-KUL cost about A$ 30 I think and the business upgrade from KUL-PVG cost about A$ 50. Both were a bargain. In economy for SYD-KUL there was more legroom than I've had on many legacy airlines. The seat was comfortable - it was fairly soft leather. It was even more comfortable with three seats to myself. Food - biryani - was excellent and good value. For KUL-SYD the business class seat was amazingly comfortable and folded almost flat: I could sleep comfortably lying on my side. On both legs FAs were friendly efficient and unobtrusive: they did an excellent job. One tip for people flying out of Sydney or Melbourne. You may be tempted as I was to buy drinks from a vending machine on airside so that you don't have to buy drinks onboard. Don't. A bottled soft drink at the airport is A$4; cans that you buy on board are RM6 which is much cheaper. The airline's only shortcoming is that you don't have IFE (although you can rent a tablet). But if you bring your own pre-loaded tablet that doesn't matter. I'll certainly fly Air Asia X in future.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2014-08-26,,I took the flight from Xian to Kuala Lumpur on my business trip and tried business class for the first time. It was perfect. The flatbed was great for red eye flight and the cabin services was tip top.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2014-08-13,,Travelled MEL-KL-HKT-BKK-KL-MEL. Flatbed/Hotseat/Hotseat/Hotseat/Flatbed. Check in fast and efficient in all locations waiting areas in KL on way to HKT inadequate HKT very inadequate BKK ok KL inadequate. Staff were excellent on plane flatbeds are worth every dollar.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2014-08-05,,Prior to boarding this flight my flight from Shandong was cancelled on numerous accounts due to the typhoon that swept through the country. I finally got to Beijing and successfully boarded the aircraft and I must say this most recent flight from (Beijing) PEK to KUL (D7317) on July 29th was simply excellent. Flight attendants brought hot beverages snacks and kept asking if I was okay. Had missed the first few days of Eid celebrations much to my surprise they went through the extra mile by bringing traditional cakes to me. After a stressful travelling experience just trying to get to Beijing the service that I got on this flight was heartwarming. The flight arrived in Malaysia far earlier than planned.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2014-08-05,,KUL to Colombo return. July 2014. This was a full flight on both legs and was on time no luggage lost and efficient. The timing of the flights were convenient and the ticket price reasonable for a family of 5. Bonus was that we no longer had to fly out of the old LCCT bus hanger.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2014-08-02,,We bought our tickets in the annual Big Sale so got a great promo price on Business class. We went from Kuala Lumpur to Adelaide on Monday 28th July. That flight left late at night so we had no hurry to get to the airport. We used the RM 10 bus from KL Sentral station to the KLIA2. It runs every half hour. In all not much longer in journey time than the airport express train. You arrive at ground level at bus and taxi area. Just inside this near gate 3 is a low cost cafeteria. Serve yourself and pay at the end. It is a fraction of the cost of eateries further inside the terminal. It is air-conditioned and clean. From here you go up and up through the Gateway shopping centre. Check in was fast and easy. Priority tags were put on our luggage. There is a quiet seating area on a mezzanine level up the escalators at the side of the passport control entrance. Passport control is quick so were hand luggage security checks. Then there is quite a long walk through to the gates area. My partner uses a walking stick. It was all possible as there are no steps. Ramps elevators and escalators! Buy your duty free at the end. Alcohol is far cheaper in KLIA2 compared to Australian duty free prices. There is a cold water fountain after the final bag security check so you can take an empty plastic bottle through to here and fill up before the flight departure lounge. The gate area has comfy seats. That's good as our flight was delayed. On board I was really surprised. The service has been re-branded as business class. This means you are served a full meal with meal pack you had ordered plus juice cake and croissant as well. We had bought an extra meal each and that came as a full meal also. The hostess asked when we wanted them served. It is pleasant to get that extra attention and extra food. We took along some apples. No-one said anything even though you are not supposed to bring your own food onboard. However the seat really does recline like an armchair. Then it turns into a flat bed. You are given a big pillow and doona blanket. Sleep is easy. If you need the toilet again easy as there is one toilet for the 12 business passengers. Sorry I can't comment much on the flight as I slept soundly after eating. Breakfast came just before arrival. So for us it was perfect.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2014-07-31,,Sydney to KL KL - Seoul. Very friendly great service I will fly AAX again and would compare them to the very best in the business it's more affordable and has aloud me to fly more often. The staff are absolutely fantastic second to none and the seat was very comfortable with good leg room.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2014-07-22,,D7 518 2 June 2014. Traveled in a Premium Business Seat to Busan and it cost me only USD50 for one way. Cabin crew were nice and friendly. Before the flight departed the cabin crew asked whether passengers wanted to be served their meals as breakfast it was great! Will travel with AAX if I get the great deals!
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2014-07-20,,Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo Tokyo to Melbourne 28 Dec 2013 to 15 Jan 2014. You pay what you need and keep the fare low is the way to go. Been travelling with AirAsia X for the past few years as my only airline to travel and without the low cost airline I probably wouldn't travel as much as I wanted to. Keep up the good work and keep your fare low with the reasonable service you provided you will see my continue using the service.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2014-07-06,,June 2014 - AirAsia. The only way to fly. Having just returned after completing a successful trip with a business colleague from the Gold Coast to Kuala Lumpur and Hanoi. I have total praise for the airline. The service provided from the moment we departed to the in flight service premium flatbed which enabled us to reach our destination totally relaxed. I have flown with AirAsia previously and will continue to do so and recommend to my colleagues.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2014-06-20,,D7 221 SYD to KLIA2 June 6 2014. Boarding was chaotic but I was assisted with a smile to my seat. The seat was so narrow and there was virtually no leg room. Thankfully another passenger's water bottle was leaking from the overhead bin onto me and the flight attendant apologised and moved me to 3 empty seats. The seats were still uncomfortable with the arms rest when lifted up and back still protruded out of the seat nudging me in the back. The food was booked online it was small but delicious nasi lemak.The cabin got cold so I was prepared to provide for my own warmth and choose not to rent a blanket. We departed and left on time. It was very cheap.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2014-06-16,,"Air Asia have removed all means of checking a ticket price on their website. week view and month view has been removed. Once a great transparent company now reduced to stealth and deception. I used them for most flights 7 long haul this year. I just tried to book some more flights but abandoned the effort and now booked on both Tiger and Virgin. It is so very difficult to find a fare now without transparent pricing. It took me over an hour to click through the days in the month I wanted to travel. I ended up frustrated and annoyed so much so I decided they will not get my money this time. Usually (mostly) I give credit where credit is due. Airasia Staff deserve credit the airline is lucky to have such great people. Given the budget airline status the seating service options such as ""paying for my sporting goods up front"" and overall experience is very good. So damn sad that they are now hiding their pricing and putting potential customers off booking with them."
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2014-06-12,,We flew from Adelaide to Kuala Lumpur on 25th May. I was really pleased with the cost of the tickets as I had bought them during a sale. I had paid extra for 2 meals each the quiet zone cabin and enough luggage allowance for us as well as a Tune sim card on arrival. I used the online check -in before departure so we only had to drop the bags at Adelaide airport. No waiting. My partner is quite old so we were allowed to board first. That gives us a couple extra minutes to put things in the overhead luggage and settle in. The quiet cabin is worth the extra money as it is kept curtained off from the back section. No kids. You aren't allowed to use it unless you have paid. There is a toilet for that cabin so all in all it is a good deal. The flight took a bit of extra time because of head winds. But as we left early we arrived pretty much on time. The flight itself was smooth and easy. The food was good as usual and the magazine is a good read. The big surprise is arrival at the new airport. It is wonderful. KLIA2. Equally as good as Suvannabhumi airport. Plenty ramps and people movers. It is great to get off the plane and be inside the airport as now air-bridges are used. Immigration was done in moments. Now there are lots of counters just ask if the counters as you come down the escalator look busy as there are another bank of immigration counters behind.. Luggage was there soon enough and we were on our way. The taxi counters are downstairs. I saw most people used the coupon system that includes all tolls. We used that too and it worked perfectly.
AirAsia X customer review,5,10,2014-06-09,,Flew from KUL-PEK in early April. It is understandable that when the weather is not that good the flight will be delayed. However it took them ages to sort things out before departure. I was one of the last few passengers to board and yet we waited onboard for quite sometime before the plane started moving. The portions for the inflight food are getting less and less every year. They don't carry enough spare food for purchase. Cabin crews showed no emotion when serving.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2014-05-19,,We were travelling in a group and the experience was good. The cabin crew were friendly and attentive. Flight was on time and our baggage also arrived on time at the new KLIA2. Choice of food and beverage on board were good and reasonably priced. Our only suggestion is for AirAsia X to consider free in-flight entertainment for flights more than 5hrs flying time/distance.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2014-05-19,,We travelled to Goldcoast recently. The flight was smooth pleasant crews and was on time. I have used Airasiax from the time they had their long haul introduced and am pleased with their service timing and food.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2014-05-18,,I was able to up-grade to flat-bed a great experience for a budget airline and the seats are almost flat. The price difference is reasonable.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2014-05-18,,The flight experience was great value for money. I find the Quiet Zone really a good concept one can sleep. But at check in the service was not great. I had no visa because I thought that I don't need one or I could do it on the spot. The staff were not well trained to assist me. They just gave me a link and I applied the wrong visa which in the end cost me AUD130 and did not allow me to fly the same day!
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2014-04-27,,KL - Taipei 16/4 - 23/4. Trip was good with on time departure and arrival. Overall environment in the cabin was nice. Crew were nice and polite most of the time. Yet to try on premium class though.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2014-04-22,,16 April KL to Taiwan on D7372. Had a great experience using AirAsia X flight from Kuala Lumpur to Taiwan and return. Five star service with low cost price can never ask for more.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2014-04-22,,Flew Premium from PER-KUL-HND and I have only few complaints. Crew are very friendly. Same with the pilots they give you regular updates about weather etc. The premium seat is comfortable and good for over night flights but it can get a bit uncomfortable when lying down because it angles down slightly so you tend to slip. Complimentary pillow and blanket both are a great size. Food is great! I had chicken lasagne which was very tasty and had a great range of flavours. The cabin was extremely clean. No mess whatsoever. One of my favourite carriers now. And it's a LCC!
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2014-04-13,,ADL-KUL-ADL. Return flight to KL in economy for an outstanding price. Very clean and fairly new ex. Dragonair A330s. Paid a little extra for the window seats in the back 8 rows as they go to two wide well worth it if traveling as a couple. Food service very prompt food itself very decent by airline standards. Flight crew very friendly and eager to help with any requests. Regular updates from the pilots. Both flight arrived slightly early. Not my first time flying with AirAsia X and still can't fault them. P.S. LCCT airport terminal in KL is quite average to say the least but the new one is opening in a couple of months I believe so it should make it even better of an experience flying to KL with AirAsia X.
AirAsia X customer review,4,10,2014-04-06,,Adelaide to Kuala Lumpur once again on board D7247. Flight left on time which was good we got into the air the seat belt sign was left on. Don't know if we were going through normal turbulence but the staff were still out and about. I was quite annoyed with the food service because it just took way too long. Its not like our flight was full also. They already informed us it would be 40 minutes in they would start serving food. An hour and 40 minutes in and they were still at the beginning of my section and the back one was still in the other section. Then we hit turbulence drinks and food was suspended. It was 2 hours into the flight until we got food. Understandable when it comes to turbulence but being over a hour well thats not acceptable especially without a full flight. Other than that the service was what you expected. Nice and friendly and was always willing to help when they could.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2014-03-30,,I traveled to Colombo on Jan 2014 on AAX from KUL-CMB-KUL in economy class on A330. I have been traveling with AAX for more than 10m times. I can tell you that the services have improved food was surprisingly good tasty and fresh but little portions. FA were attentive and professional throughout the flight. The crew were very proud of their brand AAX which is good. On the both legs the flight landed on time and we were greeted on the aircraft with smiley faces. Cabin was clean new and seat was comfortable. Problems I encountered with LCCT Terminal: too crowded and chaotic but ground staffs managed it very well. Would definitely fly again with AAX.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2014-03-30,,March 2014 Adelaide to Kuala Lumpur and from KL down to Perth a week later. Air Asia has had a number of excellent promo fares. In general $200 out of Australia and $100 into Australia. We paid $15 for seat reservation in the quiet child-free cabin. That was an excellent choice as the cabin is kept for people who booked seats in it. The curtains are drawn and the staff police it from anyone wandering in. On the Adelaide - KL sector we got a middle seat free. On the KL - Perth sector we could spread out on 3 seats each. I wouldn't bother with a premium seat unless on a night flight. We took extra food and our tablets loaded with entertainment. The meals we pre- ordered were ok. The flights went smoothly and we arrived early each time. There's an in-flight magazine in the seat back and you can always watch the stewardesses. Their uniform is world famous. The low cost terminal in KL is a shocker so you need to put on your blinkers and deal with it. There's banks a duty free shop water to drink and toilets. The new low cost terminal will open soon and it looks wonderful. We pre-purchased a SIM card and that was ready and waiting on arrival before the duty free shop so I could make calls immediately. Taxi vouchers are sold after luggage collection. And within an hour you are at your KL hotel. The departure to Perth was of a morning so we stayed at the Tune hotel near the terminal. So it was easy to make the early flight. Oh I did online check-in for both flights. Baggage drop was quick and easy. I didn't pay any attention to the offers from Optiontown as the Air Asia X product is ok. We'll be happy to use Air Asia X again any time in future.
AirAsia X customer review,,,2014-03-24,,"After being hounded by Optiontown I finally accepted the premium upgrade option. Two days before departure I received an email notification that my upgrade had been approved and the booking had been changed in the Air Asia system and I should report to the premium check in counter at KUL/LCCT to check in. As requested in the email I took a copy of the notification of the upgrade as instructed in the email for the Air Asia staff to see. When I stepped up to the premium counter for re-check in the staff said that I had not been upgraded and refused to look at the written copy of the confirmation that I was carrying and made me stand in line and wait 3.5 hours to check in. They repeatedly said they had to wait until 90 minutes prior to boarding to get the confirmation from Optiontown when the Optiontown staff were sitting not more than 15 feet behind them at the adjacent counter. Finally after refusing to go away the Air Asia girl ""conveniently"" found my upgrade in her system. I will never use this service again."
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2014-03-19,,Flew with AirAsia X 2 weeks ago from Perth to KL. Excellent flight got there quicker then the arrival time by 30mins after leaving 15mins later well impressed. Have taken AirAsia X many time to Tokyo Taiwan always great service.
AirAsia X customer review,1,10,2014-02-28,,Trip Satisfaction: Not satisfied at all. Value for Money: Not worth the money. Seat Comfort: Not comfortable at all as the seat was too small. Staff Service: Two of the staff were rude. Food and Beverages: Reasonable and affordable but didn't meet my expectation. Inflight Entertainment: This is really bad as the staff requested to return the tablet to them an hour before landing. This review is for the flight taken from Kuala Lumpur to Adelaide on 9th February 2014.
AirAsia X customer review,6,10,2014-02-07,,Flight D7247 departing Adelaide to Kuala Lumpur. Airport check-in staff were very good check in was quick and efficient thanks to online check in. They changed my seat to give me 3 empty seats. Flight left on time. Much to my disappointment I found the flight was quite empty at check in the flight looked full when we left there were 6 to 8 rows empty. Air Asia send out so many promos enticing us to buy empty seats for a flat bed. My only conclusion would be that the airline books them out to try and make the flight full to get us to upgrade. Staff were excellent and friendly food was great value for money. Arrived in KL on time there was queues just to get into the airport itself and immigration would not even fast track people with flights that were leaving soon. KL LCCC is a huge let down but the fact is for the money you pay for you need to put up with it. I have always said Air Asia has no customer service on the ground however in the air they were good.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2014-01-30,,PER-KUL-Macau-KUL-PER just before Lunar New Year Economy on the outbound Premium on the inbound leg. Friends recommended the OptionTown upgrade system and I was thrilled to check my email at 2.30 am on the morning of the flight ex Perth to see that my upgrade had been approved. It was however 'subject to availability' and the Perth airport staff told me that there had never been any upgrades available on that flight so I felt quite let down. In spite of my being tall the economy seat was comfortable enough and the food fairly tasty albeit in smallish serves. The inflight entertainment consisted of movies several years old next time I will load up a laptop with my own entertainment. Online comments had prepared me for KL LCC terminal's lack of flash facilities so I was not particularly dismayed. Just outside the toilets there was a hot and cold water fountain so it is a good idea to have an empty container to fill up there. The sandwiches at the cafe were fresh and delicious so I ordered some on the return layover as well. The free WiFi was welcome. On the flight out of Macau there was a shambolic system of checking our eligibility to land in Australia. The website was 'down' for about an hour and a bunch of passengers milled around the counter in frustration and agitation until finally getting passports back and heading for the check-in counter again. Premium was a good choice - the Macau to KL leg was in a single-class aircraft but I was placed in a 3-seat row by myself so could lie down and rest. The flat bed on the overnight flight from KL to Perth was excellent - very comfortable with a blanket and pillow supplied and attentive service from the crew. I would definitely fly Premium again as the price is far lower than other airlines' Business Class and I do not miss the alcohol service that comes with the others' far more expensive tickets.
AirAsia X customer review,3,10,2014-01-29,,Me and my wife flew AirAsia X for the very first time ADL-KUL-CMB-KUL-ADL return via Male (Transit). The first two legs leg ADL-KUL was somewhat OK mainly because of the facilities as the ADL airport. The return trip was very unpleasant. All around the cabin crew were friendly and helpful but did not serve enough drinks even when the flight was delayed. We were deprived of basic needs-water while in transit in Male (before boarding). KUL AirAsia terminal is worst than a bus terminal. Filthy hot dirty cafes generally not suitable for any type of modern day air travel especially when passengers have to take long haul flights. Narrow seating and lack of leg space made it one of my worst air travel. Gone too far to reduce the cost by maximizing seat capacity which make long haul flights (ADL/CMB vv -7 hrs) very uncomfortable. Good budget concept but gone too far in compromising basic air travel needs of passengers to low cost.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2014-01-25,,MEL-KUL-HKT return. Check in at Melbourne quick and simple but boarding was shambolic with little organisation flight ended up being delayed an hour but quickly made up in the air to only arrive 20 minutes late. The food is excellent and cheap albeit small portions it fills you up. Enough Legroom for me (178cm) but width is an issue. Transfer in KL a train wreck and LCCT Terminal looked tired and boring. Flight to Phuket was on time and had much better seating. When returning the flight to Kl was 15 minutes early and was quick transfer was a bit better. Flight to Melbourne departed only twenty minutes late but was not much of an inconvenience. In summary the food was excellent and I dare say better than I had on Emirates and cheap prices for snacks and drinks which don't bother me since I saved so much flying with them. Seats could be better but acceptable staff spoke a sufficient amount of English and were well trained. In my opinion Airasia has to be one of the best airlines I have flown.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2014-01-22,,KUL-PER on 5/12/2013 flight D7236. PER-KUL on 10/12/2013 flight D7233. Very please with this flight. Ground staff were very helpful in co-ordinating my huge check-in sports equipment which was a bicycle. Flight was very punctual in fact it took off early.
AirAsia X customer review,2,10,2014-01-20,,"I flew Hanoi to KL and then KL to Gold Coast return. Actually in the air Air Asia are just fine. They are a budget airline and they do exactly what they say they do nothing more and nothing less. If you do all your bookings online and select food etc. then it is okay. I took my own laptop with movies my own pillow and the in cabin service was fine. Their option of the ""quiet zone' - a cabin where no children under 12 are allowed - is just wonderful if you want some peace and quiet and don't want to put up with noisy kids and babies. Their on- ground service is not great but that is mainly because they are flying in and out of cheap airports with third- rate facilities and service. Optiontown is a complete waste of time and money. I paid for a chance at getting two spare seats next to me I never got them they notified me by email three hours after I left Hanoi and when I finally got my so-called 'automatic refund' I only got back 24 AUD from the original $56 USD."
AirAsia X customer review,6,10,2014-01-17,,"My partner and I flew Air Asia to Malaysia on 26/12/13 and returned to Melbourne Australia on 5/01/2014. The flight was fine but you do get what you paid for. Which is no entertainment waiting for long periods of time in the departure lounges. Having to pay for everything from blankets to water to drinks to entertainment. I am extremely disappointed that Air Asia suggests ""Optiontown"" for possible upgrades to the beds or for ""spare seats"" next to you. I paid for both options for both flights in October (Months before we departed). We didn't receive the upgrades as the options were not available due to heavy bookings. Not impressed and wouldn't be suggesting Air Asia nor this Optiontown to anyone."
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2014-01-09,,I am very pleased with my recent trip to Colombo with Air Asia X. Seats were good service was great and definitely value for money. The only downside is the menu that did not change. The same food was offered when I took the same sector in October 2013.
AirAsia X customer review,4,10,2014-01-09,,MEL to KUL then onto Cebu and back to MEL then KUL to Cebu. A disaster at check in as the computer failed. Arrived at airport at 4.30am still standing in the same spot 2 hours later. Sent to the wrong boarding gate finally got on the plane and flight attendants very blasé about the delay. MEL to KUL and back with very boring food. Check in at MEL airport took forever arrived at 10.30 pm for the flight didn't get through check in until midnight. After this experience never again.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2014-01-07,,My family and I (a group of 6) took a flight to Jeddah from Kuala Lumpur and Vice versa. It was a very good experience especially for me who had always been very sceptical on Air Asia. We were greeted politely by the ground crews air steward/stewardess. Their monthly reminder on our bookings helped a lot. Fantastic fares very good service and timely.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2013-12-29,,I flew from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur and then on to Penang and return. This was my first experience of flying with a low cost airline and it was better than I expected. I did purchase the Optiontown option for an upgrade to Premium Flatbed on both sectors SYD-KUL-SYD. I was lucky enough to get an upgrade to Premium Flatbed on the Sydney to Kuala Lumpur leg but missed out on the return. Food was fine and as ordered but I did find the entertainment tablet a bit of a waste but we learn. My criticism of the airline had to be with the ground staff and handling of passengers. The check-in at Penang could only be described as chaotic. I arrived early and decided to check in at one of the six open check-in counters. I was approached by a ground staff and asked when my flight was and was told I was too early and to come back in 1/2 hour. I did that and then stood in the queue for 1 hour and 10 minutes to check in. Every so often they would put up flight details for a specific counter but people would not move to lose their place in the queue. At the LCCT in Kuala Lumpur which would have to be one of the worst passenger terminals I have ever been in I was trying to find out about buying an upgrade to Premium Flatbed. I approached a AirAsiaX ground staff member she had no idea. She asked another staff member and I was told to stand in the queue for Sales. I did this and after nearly 25 minutes I was directed to the Premium Check in Counter. They were helpful but told me that no seats were available - the last seats had been sold about 1 minute before. I just could not believe that the ground staff did not know where to send me.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2013-12-16,,KUL-PUS-KUL. Both flights on time despite weather being not so good. Given mineral water when you board. Food very good - nasi lemak (KUL-PUS) and Thai curry (PUS-KUL). Attentive cabin crews for both sector. Seats are very good and can be reclined. I suggest premium class for long haul flights.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2013-12-10,,I have been on 8 AirAsia/AirAsiaX flights this year and will be flying with them again in January 2014. I'm 180cm and 73kgs and have no problem with the seat size and leg room. I like their no frills no nonsense attitude. The LLCT terminal in KL is a bit chaotic in a very Asian way but for me it adds to the realisation that I'm not in a pampered western pretentious terminal and my holiday is definitely under way.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2013-12-05,,An excellent flight from Sydney to KL return. On both legs I booked a seat in the economy quiet section and got three seats to myself perfect for lying out for a nap. Food and service was good as was booking in at both airports. I have certainly been recommending Air Asia X to colleagues and friends. Excellent for the price - and a direct flight too!
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2013-11-27,,KUL-TPE-KUL 9M-XXF and back with 9M-XXJ. All went smoothly excellent service with low prices.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2013-11-25,,We had flights from Bangkok to HCMC and from HCMC to the Gold Coast via KL. All flights left and arrived on time which was excellent. We paid for hot seats for extra legroom on the trip to the Gold Coast but being tall was still cramped for room in the first row behind premium. Will be flying again with Air Asia in February.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2013-11-10,,I have flown Air Asia and its partner Air Asia X several times. Regarding Air Asia X according to my two experiences so far I highly recommend this airline. Efficient easy energic and young. In our last experience flying Kuala-Gold Coast it was easy check-in process friendly staff no-extreme restrictions about carry-on luggage (in fact we travel a bit more than with the allowed 7kg!) and fast boarding process walking through to the airport. Charming and welcoming crew and easy quite wide selection of food menu onboard. If you are looking for the ultimate first class experience Air Asia X is not probably your airline. If you want to fly efficiently cheap and easy Air Asia X offers affordable flights.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2013-11-10,,Travelling with small children is always stressful no matter how prepared you are but I have to say that the staff on all our flights were excellent. Very accommodating helpful and great with the kids. The staff were always at hand and went beyond their duty providing 'peep-bo' entertainment for my two. We travelled from Sydney to Kula Lumpur which is a long way with little ones. My advice would be to take your own snacks for the kids and make sure you book your in-flight extras like hot food and the tablet as the older planes do not have built-in screens. Highly recommend with small children.
AirAsia X customer review,,,2013-10-25,,AirAsia is a disgrace. Flying from Kuala Lumpur we were not told that we could not take water on board (after the normal security section) so we had our water removed and as we had spent our last few ringits on it had no money to buy more on the plane. For a seven hour journey to Perth the staff were rude when I asked for tiny sips of water - they would only give me water from the kettle and about only about an inch of it each time I wanted some. I get that it is a 'budget airline' and that extras have to be paid for but to deny someone water when they have no money left and were not made aware that what they bought was not to be allowed this is a disgrace.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2013-10-23,,KUL(LCC)-ICN A330. As you would expect with Air Asia cheap and cheerful with no frills. Surprisingly the leg room on this flight (overnight) was quite good and I was able to sleep quite well.
AirAsia X customer review,,,2013-10-10,,We were delayed in Denpasar and couldn't get out connecting flight to Australia - Air Asia knew this but instead of organising it early they kept us waiting at the airport for 5 hours whilst they organised a bus and hotel. McDonalds and a bottle of water was offered as dinner - bad luck if you are vegetarian or do not eat fast food! The hotel was grotty and all 24 of the stranded Air Asia customers left and paid for a hotel for the next night! Will not take Air Asia again.
AirAsia X customer review,,,2013-09-24,,"The worst flight experience I have encountered despite the fact that the staff and the planes were pristine. My family (of 5) traveled from Bangkok to Christchurch NZ. We changed flights at the KL LCCT. Only 1 x-ray machine so it took over 30 minutes queuing to get into the LCCT. The whole place was grubby. It is essentially a cargo warehouse and passengers were treated like cargo. We had pre-ordered meals hot seats blankets DVD players on each of the 4 legs of the trip. When my niece could not eat the food she asked for hot water to add to Thai cup- noodles she had bought along just in case. They refused to give her hot water because they had their own Chinese style noodles even though she was prepared to pay for the water. I asked for the pre-ordered DVD player (there were none in the seats) and was told ""I don't know if we have any"" and had to ask for it a third time before I got it. The return legs were equally appalling in terms of safety and the LCCT was just as bad in the daytime 17 days later on our return. We didn't actually get hot seats until the last leg KL to Bangkok and then a Thai stewardess asked my daughter how old she was - 15 years 11 months and said we would have to move as these were exit seats and we had to be at least 16 . I've outlined some highlights here but there were too many other niggling matters that made the flights really horrible. In case you wondered we otherwise had a fantastic holiday in New Zealand."
AirAsia X customer review,1,10,2013-09-09,,Flight AK 1967 6th September 2013 seat 21D Krabi to Kuala Lumpur. Most unpleasant and unhappy flight attendants I have flown with. Seat extremely cramped. Movement between arrival/departure lounges and plane very poorly organised. My wife and I in separate rows despite checking in together! I would be extremely reluctant to fly Air Asia again.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2013-08-27,,I must have flown Air Asia at least 20 times over the past five years India Vietnam Thailand Philippines Cambodia Australia. Never had a problem. The overnight flight from Oz to KL is a bit of a pain especially if you're tall but otherwise faultless each time. The main bad point is their LCC Terminal in KL and the wait for connecting flights. It's got to be the most drab airport this side of the Soviet Union! The sole bar there is horrendously expensive and threatens to gobble up the cost savings you made by flying air Asia in the first place. Take a very good long book to read.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2013-08-27,,KUL to SYD in Premium. Booked economy and paid for an upgrade on Optiontown. All up cost a little over $A300 for a business class seat on an 8 hour flight. Wow - what else can I say? I am a 25 year member of an established carriers lounge and frequent flyer programme and after this I really wonder why? The seat is the equivalent of most flat bed international business class seats the plane clean and new and the staff amazing! Yes you pay for food and drink after one meal plus water but even this is reasonably priced. This flight was a real eye opener for me and Air Asia X will get repeat business after this.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2013-08-20,,My husband and I were so impressed with all staff on Air Asia X and Air Asia which we not only flew all the way from Gold Coast to Kuala Lumpur to Chiang Mai then onto Bangkok where we had a 12hr lay over Calcutta and then to Kuala Lumpur and home again but have flown on several other occasions. Staff were professional friendly and efficient. I would also have to say meals were great so much nicer than other airlines offering.
AirAsia X customer review,,,2013-08-18,,"If Air Asia was the only flight I could afford then I can't afford to fly. LCC airport was dirty overcrowded and in need of general maintenance. When leaving Perth check in experience was good and we left on time. Checking in to come home (2 flights) were late and we were seated 20 rows apart for the 2nd and longest leg of the journey - as were 3 other Australian couples on the same flight. A330 has small seats with no leg room for anyone taller than 5'3""."
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2013-08-08,,Flew MEL-KL-Penang-Phuket-MEL. Not one single problem. One flight was 30 mins delayed but arrived on time. Flew night flights MEL-KUL return with 2 young kids. Kids slept 7 of the 8 hrs. A bit tight for me but I'm 6ft 2 and 106kg its tight on full service flights. Had dinner before leaving slept 3 of 8 hrs smooth flight. Read a book and listen to music. I relaxed all the easy no lawns to now no dishes to do. I'd fly Air Asia again.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2013-07-24,,Flew PEK-KUL. Flight left Beijing with just a minor delay due to a late arrival. The cabin crew were very friendly and before take off confirmed our meal request and informed us that we would be woken 1 hour before arrival for breakfast. The lie flat beds were ideal for the overnight flight especially as the economy section appeared to be 100% full. The pillow and blanket provided were especially soft which helped get a full 6 hour sleep. For the extra cost I would fully recommend AirAsia X Premium.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2013-07-21,,My wife and I flew from KL to Melbourne in the Premium Flat bed cabin. There are only 12 seats in this cabin with 2 rows in a 2x2x2 configuration per row. The seats are spacious and comfortable. Plenty of overhead locker space for cabin bags. All 12 seats were occupied. There is one toilet for use by the 12 occupants in the cabin. Before take-off we were given a free bottle of water which was a nice gesture considering the heat in KL from the walk from the terminal to the plane. We were asked when we would like to have our included meals served and the meals arrived at the specified time. The priority baggage system worked well and our suitcases were among the first few to be delivered at the baggage carousel in Melbourne. Included baggage allowance is 25 kg. In future we will fly with Air Asia again in the Premium cabin.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2013-07-10,,Haneda-KL in 2013 March. This route is a ideal gateway to have a business trip to East Asian countries such as Indonesia Philippines Thailand. This time my destination was Yangon. In this case transit time was not good. I had to spend one night at the airport. Hopefully they will set adequate transit times - would be more useful for busy business use in the future.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2013-07-07,,Travelled SIN - KL - OOL and back on Air Asia X. Superb service. Upon checking in at SIN we had forgotten to arrange for luggage services but fortunately with some assistance by the ground staff we got it sorted out in good time. Food on board was great. Had 2 green curry rice on my long flight. Great tasting value for money! Flight attendants were fantastic on board. I liked the fact that each badge showed the country where the FA is from. fantastic idea. Seats were great with the adjustable head rest which can go up or down depending on your height. Transit at KL was smooth and effortless. Fantastic trip overall. Highly recommended.
AirAsia X customer review,4,10,2013-06-19,,KUL to PER. Staff as we were leaving to go up the steps to board the aircraft were all checking their phones staff just seem to be getting slacker and slacker. The flight was a shambles service was so slow getting the meals out that we were too tired and just wanted to sleep. Cabin was boiling hot just absolutely stifling. Everything about Air Asia is going downhill I have been flying with them for years with 10+ flights a year and it is getting worse. Now that Malaysia Airlines are dropping their prices I am switching to them.
AirAsia X customer review,5,10,2013-06-10,,Melbourne to KL on the overnighter. Left and arrived on time. Big problem these days with Air Asia X after many years of complaints is that the cabin was far too cold now it's far too hot. As the full plane was loading one could feel how stifling and hot it was. This didn't improve during the flight in fact many blankets pre-purchased were not even taken out of the plastic bag. Other issue were the flight attendants. Sure its the overnighter but we rarely saw them in Economy. Arrived in KL feeling cooked from an oven. The seats are just ok but would have been more comfortable if passengers were not sweating into the seats.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2013-05-27,,Flew from HatYai Thailand to Bangkok. Was a bit sceptical regarding the flight as I am used to European low cost airlines but I have to say that this was excellent. Everything was smooth even landed 10 minutes early. Cabin crew were professional and the flight was smooth and felt safe.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2013-05-26,,Took the flight from KL-Sydney for the third time. I must start by saying that each trip was better than the previous one. The flight attendants on Air Asia X was outstanding. Very composed friendly and helpful. I always choose the last row of seats as it closer to the under-utilized washroom and you get your meals first! Plus its closer to where the air crew usually take a break hence am able to speak to them casually. The vegetarian lasagne was outstanding as usual always get it as its actually tasty. Flight was on time and umbrellas provided at the LCCT as it was raining was very helpful as well. Overall I will continue to fly Air Asia X.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2013-05-21,,KL to Gold Coast. 17/5/2013 evening flight. Often travelled economy class with AAX in past years. Thanks to promo offer we now experienced the extra comfort with exclusive premium class. We had a good few hours of sleep. That makes a obvious difference.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2013-05-20,,I travelled on a flight to Incheon in early May 2013 and the service from the ground level to the in flight service was efficient. The flight was on time on both routes to and fro and the waiting time for check-in luggage was relatively quick. The upgrade to the empty seat option was also good and surprisingly a comfortable option that allowed me to sleep on the flight without experiencing any body aches. Would recommend it to passengers travelling on long distance flights.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2013-05-19,,My Air Asia flight was a very pleasant surprise. The flight crew were happy and professional the food was good and the flat bed with cosy blanket and pillow was exactly what I needed for a great sleep. We left on time and landed well ahead of schedule - you can't ask for more than that.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2013-05-01,,OOL-KUL. Night flight from Gold Coast return. Flight on time in both directions. Clean planes and great service. Day flight on way back and had pre ordered samsung tabs which we worthwhile. Food was one of the better airline meals we have had. Vegetarian lasagne and pancakes recommended. Even managed to get a spare seat on the way back as the flight wasn't that full.

AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2013-04-28,,Flew CRK-MEL via Kuala Lumpur would fly them again as price is good. Aircraft's are clean staff both good on both ways. Thank goodness they are in CRK as this is less congested and more accessible than MNL.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2013-04-16,,I flew DPS-KUL-REP and KBV-PEK (via KUL). Overall great crew and service the price was excellent and legroom was just ok. Crew helped with boarding as all flights were full I have nothing to complain about apart from the chaotic LCCT airport.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2013-04-14,,Kuala Lumpur to Osaka Kansai International in late March 2013. Booked Quiet Zone seats checked in on the web. Outbound flight arrived early (favourable winds) while return flight departed early but arrived 10 mins late (headwind and turbulence). Ground service at both KLIA LCCT and Osaka KIX were efficient. Flights were uneventful. Return flight was less comfortable and arrived with a neck ache. Might be due to the old aircraft's seats.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2013-04-02,,Return flight KL to SYD for my wife 3 year old daughter and myself. Late night flight out of LCCT only inconvenience was walking to plane and up the stairs - so old fashioned. Felt like we won the lottery with optiontown the 3 of us upgraded to sleepers my daughter slept all the way and we carried her off in SYD still asleep.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2013-03-27,,Just came back to Malaysia from Melbourne. Other than the crowded Malaysia LCCT airport there is nothing else that I can complain about. I'm paying half the ticket fee of other 'bigger' airlines but both services are very similar. Seats are similar size. Check-in check-out procedures are similar. I'm more than happy to lose a free packet of nuts and flight meals.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2013-03-26,,My husband and I traveled back from Sydney for Chinese New Year in February via Air Asia X. It was a very pleasant experience the ground crew were efficient and helpful and handled the passengers well. The inflight crew was friendly and offered us assistance with our requests. All in all the experience was as good if not better than a non-budget airline.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2013-03-13,,"My family and I flew to Seoul Korea and back via AirAsiaX for a 5 day trip in January 2013. The check-in process was quick and easy. The flight crew were friendly and helpful. The plane arrived and departed on time. No complaints and definitely ""value for money"". We will be flying again with AirAsiaX to Shanghai this weekend."
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2013-03-05,,Took an Air Asia X flight to Japan. Flight arrived early and the staff were very helpful. Seat was comfortable enough for me to doze off the entire 6 hours back to Kuala Lumpur (a pretty difficult thing to do for me!). Savings made on the flight was used for fun and exciting things during the trip. Great value for money!
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2013-03-05,,Had a 7 hour flight to Japan via AirAsia X. It was a great experience - plenty of good options for food on board excellent staff service with friendly flight attendants and the inflight entertainment tablet that I got was loaded with movies TV shows magazines and music! I also enjoyed reading the Travel 360 magazine.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2013-03-04,,Travelled to Japan with AirAsia X in February. The tickets were extremely reasonable far cheaper than any other airline. Despite being a low cost carrier the experience was pretty good! The flight attendants were attentive and friendly there was plenty of a variety in food options and they had inflight entertainment ipads that could be purchased as well. Flight arrived on-time no delays or issues.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2013-03-04,,Flew PER-KUL return. Seat was tight but comfortable for the flight. No entertainment and we did not purchase any food besides water. Flight crew were professional attentive and helpful. Some more willing than others. Everything went smoothly. The LCCT wasn't that fantastic in term of aesthetics yet it is functional. Need aerobridge instead of walking to the airport/aircraft. Looking forward to the opening of KLIA2. Will fly AAX again.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2013-02-23,,An 8hr flight down to Melbourne was definitely a much better experience than I thought it would be. The seats were comfortable (for a flight) and the staff service good. It's basically like getting on a regular typical international flight like any other except at an unbelievable price! As always AirAsia X is my number 1 choice.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2013-02-20,,Excellent experience travelling in premium class from Sydney on 3rd Jan 2013 - superb flatbed (we slept throughout the flight). Kept warm and comfortable (love the duvet and pillow). Cabin crew friendly and attentive to our needs. Will definitely travel AirAsia X again.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2013-02-19,,I travelled premium class to Sydney on 10th October 2012 - it was a very pleasant experience. Leg room and privacy stands on top of my criteria in terms of seat comfort and Air Asia Premium Class offers just that. The flight attendants were understanding and polite. Premium class seats are also very comfortable and spacious. Food on the flight was better than expected in terms of taste and proportion. I will strongly recommend the Premium Class for long haul flights to anyone who can grab a good deal out of it.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2013-02-15,,Had a very good experience flying from KL to Melbourne and back. The main thing I was looking for on this business trip was to sleep well and not to be disturbed too much. The food was decent and the 8 hour flight passed quickly. I thought service was good - the staff were attentive and accommodating. The flight was slightly delayed going out but we made up for most of it and landed about 15 minutes late.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2013-02-15,,KL to Melbourne late November last year with a big group. We had lots of sport equipment which we pre booked online making it easy at the LCCT. Check-in was easy and the group got through fast without any problems. We also pre-booked our meal hot chicken lasagne. Flight was very relaxed onboard I was the only one of our group that got an inflight entertainment system movies were good. The fast and efficient service in all areas of our trip made us want to use Air Asia again the next time we travel.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2013-02-07,,KUL-Seoul. Thanks to the online system it's very convenient to book my ticket with particulars such as the ticket pricing airport taxes luggage costs and insurance fees made clear. Checking-in luggage is also made easy via web and I checked-in my luggage 7 days before the actual departure. The departure was punctual as scheduled. Enough seating space for my legs to be stretched out. Satisfied with the overhead space for hand luggage. Reading is easy with private overhead lighting which doesn't disturb others. Food offered was uniquely Malaysian though it could've been better if everything offered was available. Toilets were satisfactorily clean. My luggage arrived safely according to schedule.
AirAsia X customer review,1,10,2013-01-02,,Flew return PER-KUL. Terrible service dirty planes and smaller seats compared to other airlines using same A330.
AirAsia X customer review,6,10,2012-12-17,,I flew Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur and return. If flying from Melbourne I strongly suggest to use online check- in. They had only one check-in counter open for regular check-ins and 6 for online. As a result despite arriving at the airport a full two and a half hours before departure I and many other passengers had to run through the airport to get the gate in time. Pre-purchased food was uninteresting and one of them almost cold. Legroom is pretty bad. The staff are generally quite friendly and helpful. Check-in immigration etc at LCCT were all much easier and faster than Melbourne.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2012-12-14,,KUL-PER-KUL flight and although my prior departure to Perth was unpleasant when I landed as my bike bag was not loaded on the aircraft and ended up being sent to me on the next flight instead however ground staff were efficient in locating my missing bike bag immediately. My return trip was pleasant. The flight crew very accommodating. This flight was certainly value for money in terms of comfort and service.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2012-11-05,,KUL-MELMEL-KUL check in good and fast friendly staff. Airbus 330-300 very clean with a lot of legroom friendly staff on board and food was not expensive. All flights on schedule.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2012-10-29,,First time on Air Asia X from Melbourne to KUL return. Both legs on time. The 3-3-3 seating was fine even though 2-4-2 is the norm for the A330. The Pak Nasser's nasi lemak lived up to its promise. No IFE but with portable entertainment units such as tablets and smartphones so widespread one can just bring your own. I just watched movies on my Macbook. The new LCCT cannot come any sooner. The current one is pretty much a converted warehouse.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2012-10-21,,SYD-KUL in Premium. 45 mins late departing. Premium cabin was very comfy. The crew very good and like the outbound trip we were asked when we would like to eat. We chose to eat at 1 hr and 5 hrs into the journey. Pre-ordered food was hot and delicious. My wife had requested special gluten free meals and this had been arranged by AAX HQ in Kuala Lumpur. Premium cabin was quiet. No in flight entertainment but you can rent a Samsung tablet for 45RM. We landed at KL LCCT (raining again) walked to passport control - which was deserted - and then down to baggage reclaim. Within 15 mins of arriving at the gate we had exited Customs and were getting into our taxi. All in all a very nice journey indeed. I will have no hesitation in flying AAX Premium again.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2012-10-21,,KUL-SYD. Overnight flight and the 'lay flat' premium seats were quite comfy and I managed to sleep. The crew were very good and did not bother us with any unnecessary sales pitches for food or duty frees. Shortly after take off we were asked when we would like to eat. I gave a time of 2 hours before landing and the food arrived on schedule. An enjoyable journey and the Premium cabin is a very good product. The only downside was that at LCCT you walk to the plane there are no aero bridges (until the new LCCT opens in 7 months time) and it was raining heavily when we boarded and had to dodge big puddles on the tarmac. I have no hesitation in recommending AAX Premium Cabin.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2012-10-15,,MEL-KUL aircraft seemed new seats had more legroom than my return journey on Malaysian Airlines and the food was much more tasty than Malaysian. Inflight entertainment was non existent personally if they had a screen on the back of the seats with a credit card swipe facility I would be more than happy to pay for the service I don't like tablet screens though so I wouldn't rent one of their Samsung units. Overall it was a very reasonable flight great flight attendants arrived on time and price was one quarter than Malaysian wanted. Just need more flights MEL-KUL now a 3rd daily would definitely fill up with their competitive pricing!
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2012-09-24,,PER-KUL. A330-300. Flight left a little late - seemed a little unorganised. In flight entertainment non existent (unless you rent a PSP/Samsung tab with pre-loaded films/games etc for - A$15) but that aside the onboard product was very good. Impressive range of meals to chose from with snacks and drinks at affordable prices - they were half the price than the airport. New and clean cabin. The 3x3x3 seat layout is a little narrow but it's a low cost carrier after all.
AirAsia X customer review,2,10,2012-09-23,,"KUL-KTM. Arrived at the airport to find out that the flight had been delayed by over 3 hrs no prior notification from the airline whatsoever premium check in was quick and was told by the check in lady that the flight had been ""re-timed "" a good substitution for the word delay I suppose. Boarding meant for 2.30 pm did not even commence by 3.15 pm and there was no information passed onto us. Only after a few angry passengers made their way to the gate counter were they told eventually at 4 pm that the flight had been cancelled. Again no apologies at all and we were made to sit for almost 90 mins before they let us out of the gate lounge way back through immigration and then get out bags and finally onto a bus to the hotel that was arranged for us for the night. The flight eventually flew the next morning at 9.30 am. The way Air Asia X staff handled the situation was worse than appalling no apologies no information passed on in fact they seemed the ones who were agitated with all the questions being asked to them and not us who were there at the airport by 9 am and only got to leave at 5.30pm. The plane an Airbus 330 was clean and the inflight service as per your AA standards."
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2012-09-12,,I travelled from Perth to Kuala Lumpur return with Air Asia. This was my first flight with this airline and with budget airlines. It was a pleasant experience and I am planning on more trips with Air Asia. The staff were charming and helpful and the plane was new and almost as tidy at the end of the flight as it was at the beginning.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2012-09-04,,OOL-KUL. Having flown with AirAsiaX a number of times years ago (which I think the experience was acceptable for a no-frills airline) this last flight I did was nothing but excellent and exceeded my expectation even though the flight was delayed by more than 24 hours. Bad weather was the reason why the aircraft that we were supposed to get on that morning could not land in OOL and was instead diverted to BNE. Ground crew in OOL handled the situation extremely well by keeping us up-to-date about the situation every half hour. As the situation developed we were offered cash vouchers to get lunch at the airport. At first the crew were trying (very hard) to bus everyone to BNE and fly us out from there on the same day but BNE airport authority wouldn't allow them to do so. Without further delay we were offered a night stay at a hotel in Gold Coast with dinner cash vouchers and free bus rides to and from the hotel so we could take the flight out the next morning.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2012-08-29,,KUL-SYD return. KUL LCCT was chaotic and premium check-in counter hard to find. Once there luggage drop- off was quick staff polite. No separation between premium and economy in entering holding room. Long uncertain wait with unclear announcements. Separate boarding of plane between premium (first) and economy (slightly later). Cabin was 2-4-2. Seat-Bed was approx flat with a slight drop-off below the calf. Incline of approx 15% to floor but comfortable enough. One simple hot meal with bottle of water included. Left punctually and arrived on time.
AirAsia X customer review,5,10,2012-08-23,,OOL - KUL return. A great idea for a budget carrier to have premium seats. Pity they didn't consider making them long enough for the average traveller. Seat comfort is great for a day time flight pretty woeful for a night time flight. Entertainment provided on a portable tablet (that has to be paid for) and the content is fairly pathetic. One free meal provided and it was average but the satay which can also be pre-ordered is ok. I'm not sure I would choose this carrier again but you get what you pay for and if you don't have high expectations then it's you might think it's value for money.
AirAsia X customer review,5,10,2012-08-21,,KUL-TPE return in premium class. Well kept A330 comfortable angled lie flat seats. There were just 3 seats occupied and cabin was quiet and peaceful. 2 free bottles of water and a meal provided. Outbound flight was delayed by 1 hr return by over 2 no apology/explanation given. This Airlines has a lot of potential but substantial delays on both ways does not allow me to recommend this medium/long haul carrier.
AirAsia X customer review,2,10,2012-08-09,,KUL-SYD on A330-300 in economy. Check-in was easy and staff were friendly. Pre-booked seats given. Boarding was a little chaotic but at least the walk to the plane wasn't too far this time. Seats are very narrow with poor recline. It is very uncomfortable on an overnight flight. There is 9-abreast seating when it is normally only 8-abreast on the same aircraft on full-service carriers. The headrest is also very uncomfortable. Hand-carry luggage was not properly monitored which caused some problems with boarding. Comfort amenities only provided if paid for. Meals (either pre-booked or paid for onboard) were small and of poor quality. Cabin crew were a little disorganised but generally friendly and helpful. Flight was generally on time. I would definitely pay more for an economy seat on a full-service carrier especially on overnight flights.
AirAsia X customer review,5,10,2012-08-08,,SYD-KUL on A330-300. Successful upgrade to Premium through Optiontown. Check-in at SYD was fast and easy. No fast-track through immigration or security but this is a budget carrier after all. Priority boarding provided. Premium seats comfortable and are angled flat. This is a basic version of the business class seat one would get on a full-service carrier. Pillow and blanket provided. One complimentary meal provided which is the same as economy but it was small and not very good either. No entertainment provided unless paid for. Cabin crew were generally friendly but not particularly attentive. Flight was on time. The LCCT in KUL is a terrible terminal. There are no aerobridges and the walk to the terminal can be quite long. It is also chaotic and has poor signage especially when trying to work out transport options such as transferring to KLIA or catching the train into the city. I'd avoid flying AirAsia just to avoid going through this terminal!
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2012-07-19,,Wonderful to be able to experience business-level comfort at slightly more than economy prices (and less than premium economy in full service carriers). The experience was first class and the flight attendants were most graceful and attentive.
AirAsia X customer review,6,10,2012-07-15,,MEL-KUL. An 8.5 hour flight on A330-300 on premium class. The flight was delayed a few minutes. Really comfortable seat. Meals were OK but lack of choices. They really need to add some more meal choices. Moreover some of the meals on the menu ran out quickly. No inflight entertainment at all but it can be understood since it's a low cost flight. However it will be great if they provide entertainment for premium class passengers. Friendly and attentive flight attendants.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2012-07-15,,Traveled OOL-KUL-SIN then HGH-KUL and then KUL-OOL. With one exception the flights were on time or early the crew were helpful friendly and efficient. Our pre-booked meals were of a high standard the food available for purchase on board also appeared to be very reasonably priced coffee was 5MYR per cup (around AU/US$1.70 per cup). In all cases the aircraft were young clean and in very good condition. On our initial two stage flight our baggage was checked to the final destination and we were able to simply use the transit facilities at LCCT instead of having to go through Immigration baggage collection Customs and rechecking etc. The seats were comfortable but a little narrower however unless you're overweight this shouldn't be a problem legroom appeared to be comparable with other airlines. We've flown with a range of full service airlines and previously with AAX in our opinion AAX rates very favourably and if you can buy their sale fares they represent outstanding value. We wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again!
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2012-07-03,,Sydney to Bangkok via KUL. I finally got some cheap fares for $120 one way. The plane was 10 min late due to heavy traffic in Sydney. Boarding was swift fast and very organised. I have to say for a low budget airline this would have to be one the most organised organisations I have ever flown with. Once in the air the captain greeted us with pretty good English. Food was offered my family and I had pre-booked our meals which were excellent. I recommend the nasi lemak which if you like spicy food you will love. My wife and kids had the international meal which was chicken lasagne. We pre-booked the entertainment pack which I don't recommend as there is only a few movies TV shows and music. The flight was very smooth with minimal turbulence. The plane was a 2 year old A330-300 which was clean but looked used for its age. Once at KUL low cost terminal it was a fast and efficient disembarkement. Please note once off the plane you have to walk to the terminal. Only one major negative with this trip was that we had to wait 4 hours for a transfer to Bangkok but if your not fussed about that as we had young children then Air Asia is for you.
AirAsia X customer review,1,10,2012-06-27,,Major setback for my recent flight back to Melbourne from Kuala Lumpur on the 23rd June 2012. My pre- booked 'hot seat' was next to the narrow aisle and was constantly bumped by their clumsy trolley. The ambience of the cabin was hot when I asked about it the cabin crews were clueless and unsympathetic. I shall never fly with them again in the future even if the price is marginally lower than other premium airlines.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2012-06-19,,Flew KUL-ICN-KUL with AAX Standard seats. Warm cabin crew pre-booked meals were okay seats and overall experience inflight was good and value for money. However the finishing touches of the airline was really touching they arranged for a surprise welcome home for me at the request of a friend. Thank you AAX!
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2012-06-17,,CHC-KUL return. Seats narrow but leg room was ok. Pre ordered meals were small but very good for the price but they ran out of other buy on board food. Crew very friendly and the buy on board service has reasonable prices. The light were turned off on the cabin very late for a night flight which was annoying. Very good value considering the price of their fares.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2012-06-12,,SYD-KUL-SYD. Ground service helpful and prompt. Appreciate easy baggage drop for Internet check-in. High passenger utilisation of cabin starting to show eg: frayed carpet toilets not flushing properly etc. Internal lighting level also appeared too low. Overall cabin presentation on both occasions was respectable but not better than Jetstar long haul. Onboard FA service was well timed efficient and friendly.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2012-06-10,,Perth-KUL-Ho Chi Minh-KUL-Denpasar-KUL-OOL. Good value for money. Good seating and crew were helpful and courteous. No problem with the food. I did find their terminal at KUL chaotic and lack lustre and you have to walk a long way to the plane in some instances. I paid for the Optiontown upgrade and got the one from Perth to KUL which was nice. Wouldn't get to experience that on another airline! I give them a thumbs up for making flying affordable.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2012-06-05,,SYD-KUL return - First flight with AirAsia X but have flown AirAsia domestic and Thai AirAsia. No surprises for me I booked my seats and food. Paid around $400 return less than half the price of QA BA or MAS. Did not get to use the inflight entertainment system and I was a little bored on the flight out of Sydney flight time was a little over 9 hours due to weather. Food was good. FA's friendly. On the flight back I paid for hot seats (35B and 35C). Had plenty of leg room but got woken up by people slamming the toilet door and standing in the space next to the exit talking really loudly. The only issues I had with the flight was the other passengers. I managed to buy an extra meal on the way back and it was good. My bag was damaged but I am sure this was due to the lethal baggage carousels at SYD. If you fly AAX pre-book your seats and your meals.
AirAsia X customer review,1,10,2012-05-30,,The staff constantly see the need to come behind the curtain exposing two bright lights to passengers who pay the privilege of sitting in row 1A in executive class. These insensitive staff feel the need to conduct a loud and animated conversation within the executive cabin throughout the night. We pay for lie flat beds and are constantly subjected to being woken up at constant period throughout the night and not from fellow passengers. The food is poor and who cares for duty free so why do they need to charge down the aisle every 15 minutes. My rubbish was never collected.
AirAsia X customer review,3,10,2012-05-30,,MEL-KUL. The check-in was smooth but the check-in counter at Melbourne was overcrowded and the queue ridiculously long. Check-in staff carried out her duty in a rather unfriendly manner and my assumption was because we opted for low cost carrier and hence be seen as substandard. Boarding was painfully slow but it was with other airlines as well. The aircraft was jam-packed and the cabin interior was lacklustre. My pre- order of Pak Nasser's Nasi Lemak was excellent perhaps the only great point about the entire journey. The 'hot seat' as it might sound had plenty of legroom but the seat was equally small and uncomfortable (not worth the AUD 45 at all). It was a relief that there was no delay throughout the journey. As always AirAsia X is a low-cost carrier and I will think twice before I book for my next flight with AirAsia X.
AirAsia X customer review,1,10,2012-05-27,,Kuala Lumpur - Taipei. There was a huge delay for our flight to Taipei and we sat in the uncomfortable cabin for almost an hour before the aircraft decided to take off. Passengers queue up for WC even when there was turbulence and the flight attendants were unprofessional and inefficient in the way they managed the unruly crowd. The only good thing was that they allowed me to change my seat.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2012-05-22,,I booked a $99 intro fare plus $50 of extras from SYD-KUL and requested an OptionTown upgrade for $115 in the Premium cabin. Check-in at Sydney was easy with a separate Premium check-in desk so no waiting. I had seat 1G on A330 so plenty of legroom in the middle bulkhead seat with a budget version of angled lie-flat seating. Left the gate 10 mins early after take-off the crew handed out pillows quilts and any pre-ordered entertainment devices and meals. They gave me the choice to eat later which was appreciated. There is a BOB menu of basic Asian and western snack items and drinks. The problem with the cabin crew is that there was not obvious way to determine if and when they where serving food or drinks. You simply had to get their attention as they whizzed past. The portable video/music unit I was given failed to produce any sound so was sent back to be replaced by a second until that was taped together. The crew were quite pleasant.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2012-05-16,,SYD-KL return. Staff were friendly and efficient. Plane was new and comfortable. Smooth flights both ways good food easy check-in. Inflight entertainment was a bit limited however not a huge issue on an 8 hour flight. This was my first flight on a low cost carrier and would not bother with anyone else if air Asia is available. LCCT terminal in Malaysia is sufficient plenty of eateries.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2012-05-13,,SYD-KUL. These flights were ridiculously cheap and although I was fearful it was not a bad experience. The main disadvantage of using this airline is the LCCT at KUL which is just a hassle in terms of transport and facilities. I took KLIA transit which was ok. The plane (A330) was pretty neat and the seat was comfortable. The plane was packed for both flights. Meals can only be pre-ordered and are not available for sale. No entertainment options were offered. Both flights were about 30 mins late. I applied for optiontown upgrades on both flights but did not get either. On line check-in worked well but there are no 2D barcode scanners at Sydney airport.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2012-05-09,,On my latest trip from Sydney to KUL I tried Air Asia X new flight in Premium Class. The trip exceeded my expectations on all key dimensions of: Check In - smooth and 'prioritised' for Premium Seats - comparable with all main premium competitors Inflight service - warm and friendly Food - some of the best Nasi Lemak I have tasted. Summary: Excellent value.
AirAsia X customer review,5,10,2012-05-07,,I would refrain from using this budget again especially on long flights like Sydney-KUL as even basic essentials like free access to drinking water is charged for seats are ridiculously narrow (9 abreast when the Airbus seating should have been 2-4-2 rather than 3-3-3). Not good for long haul passengers.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2012-04-24,,CHC-KUL KUL-SIN SIN-KUL KUL-CHC. On all 4 flights I took over a 2 week period my expectations of this low budget carrier were pleasantly exceeded. Flight crew are very good and efficient. On CHC-KUL flight we were seated at the rear of the aircraft and attendants offered the middle row of seats for us to lie down on. Both meal services offered different dishes which were still hot when they arrived - food was very nice. I am 6ft 3in so was surprised by the leg room. My only gripe would be that when completing online check-in my travel companion and I were separated and I had to pay to have us seated together. We paid extra to be seated in the hot seats to find that the plane was only half full.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2012-04-22,,Gold Coast to Kuala Lumpur premium economy. Great experience and would fly Air Asia again without hesitation. Flat beds only 12 premium seats so very quiet. Service attentive. Food average but who needs a lot of food and alcohol when flying out at 9.25pm. My daughter booked separate booking GC-KL and then KL to Phuket and was made to collect her bags in KL whereas mine went straight through. Collecting the bags and re-checking them in was a nightmare. LCCC the low cost terminal is everything they say it is. Crowded disorganized and a poor reflection.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2012-04-11,,After travelling Air Asia on a rugby trip from Christchurch through to KUL and then on to Clarke. I have nothing but great things to say about this so called budget airline. Food was great and staff were fantastic. Seats were great and all ground staff were happy to help. Its a shame that Air Asia have to pull out of Christchurch.
AirAsia X customer review,2,10,2012-04-10,,Kuala Lumpur-Incheon Airport. Food was cold. Cabin crew sometimes rude when called. Seat space was really small. The seat across is 3-3-3 despite being A330-300 aircraft which should have 2-4-2 seat seating. Inflight entertainment was limited.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2012-03-29,,Aircraft took off and landed in Kuala Lumpur on time. Despite being a low-cost carrier Air Asia X provided an excellent inflight service. Stewards were on hand to help passengers with luggage. Very comfortable and spacious seats. Overall it has provided a better inflight experience than many other carriers I have taken.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2012-03-26,,KUL-KIX-KUL in Premium Class. Check-in was quick and efficient however flight was delayed almost 3 hours. Communication was not very good but after 2 hours they handed out water and muffins. Onboard the seat was comfortable and much better padded than other airlines. Food is same as economy the crew was very friendly efficient and professional. Return flight on time and I slept for 6 hours. A great service for a low-cost airline in their premium cabin.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2012-03-22,,LGW-KUL. Managed to obtain promotion fare which was too good to pass up even once I had paid for extras like food entertainment and baggage. Very positive experience. I was impressed with the service but disappointed to learn that the flight stops running next week. My aircraft was about one third full even at those prices.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2012-03-06,,ORY-KUL-PER MEL-KUL-ORY. You exactly get what you pay for. We were aware of that so the experience was overall positive. The only thing that seems unnecessary is that you have to collect your bags in KUL check them in again a couple of minutes later. Overall the flights were uneventful. AirAsia X offers a very cheap option to Australia (less than 700 EUR return).
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2012-03-01,,KUL-TSN-KUL. Very comfortable flight however the that FA was rude and unfriendly. The pre-booked meal was very small and not tasty. Overall value for money.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2012-02-28,,CHC-KUL-CHC. Very comfortable flight no different than one of the more expensive carriers. The 1 prepaid meal was disappointingly small for the price paid. Also when booking price rose substantially. The usual add ons however the top $90 fuel surcharge. What is that? Overall an excellent airline using nice modern aircraft. Far cheaper than the alternatives and would definitely use them again where possible.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2012-02-27,,PER-KUL-MEL and was pleasantly surprised. Bought fares on sale so wasn't expecting much but the service was good leg room the usual and flights on time. Happy with the inflight entertainment and food was fine. They are a great budget airline.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2012-02-24,,LGW-KUL-LGW. If you get a promo fare there is little to complain about. Paid a basic fare of £260 return with additional fees for food and seating choice raising it to around £300. Paid for meals are very good but small portions. Check-in staff at Gatwick were very strict with baggage weight many were made to re-pack. No such problem at KUL. Our flights were 60% full so able to take a row for the 2 of us. Otherwise it would be pretty tight for a 14 hour flight. Cabin staff were friendly cheerful and helpful. Shame they are due to stop this service in May.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2012-01-13,,KL-MEL in Premium class. The wider lay flat beds are fantastic for the price they are not exactly lay flat but close enough and the duvet and pillow make it comfortable. Food served is same as economy and Air Asia is known for their quality food (Asian selection only) its tasty and a good portion size. Staff are friendly and attentive.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2012-01-06,,"KUL-LGW-KUL and KUL-ORY-KUL on premium seats. The website booking was efficient and so was online check-in. Bag drop was a little tricky at LCCT but this could be due to sudden surge of passengers given the Christmas break. Onboard experience has been pleasant with friendly flight attendants comfortable seats good food comfortable pillows and duvets. Snacks served onboard were also good we had a croissant during the ORY-KUL flight. We didn't use the entertainment option. Ground crew particularly customer care in KL and check-in counters at ORY were helpful. Would highly recommend premium seats over other airlines' business class seats. An area for improvement would be that the onboard toilets were a little ""over-used"" and could potentially cause problems on long-haul flights in terms of cleanliness."
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2011-12-12,,I recently flew KUL-LGW return and was impressed with the leg room and quality of inflight service. For a long haul low cost airline it's definitely at par or better than MAS. I would definitely fly with Airasia X again.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2011-12-09,,I recently flew KL-Christchurch return. It was my first time on AirAsia X. Given that I am over 6 feet I was very impressed with the leg room available. I sat 2 rows from the back. The new planes complimented by excellent service made it an enjoyable trip too. Consistency on the return trip was nice!
AirAsia X customer review,6,10,2011-12-07,,LGW-KUL return. On the outbound leg we had the hot seats which have plenty of legroom but I found the middle seat I was in agonisingly narrow the tray table is built into the armrest leaving me feeling wedged in and very uncomfortable. If you are of larger build you will find that the regular seats with armrests that fold up are much more comfortable. A340 both ways were clean and in good order but both legs ran slightly late. Crew 'okay' nothing more. Food pretty poor and along with drinks even water have to be paid for. Remember cash or you'll be having a very thirsty flight! Return leg much more comfortable as we sat near the rear in the two seats together where the cabin narrows in regular seats.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2011-12-06,,London-KL-Christchurch return. On all four flights very comfortable and well looked after by a professional crew. The food is good while the best value is in the cup-of-noodles. Air Asia X refrains from making lengthy annoying announcements nor does it draw out the meal service one is accustomed to on full-service airlines. You can ask for a meal at any time between services. Cabins are clean as are the bathrooms at all times which is appreciated. The A330 KL-CHC-KL is brand new and worth getting a seat in the last 6 rows which are spaced 2-3-2 for more comfort. Onboard food is very expensive when paying in NZD. A similar problem for AUD EUR and GBP too so always best to have MYR handy. For £520 return a great deal and felt great at the end of all flights.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2011-11-04,,KUL-DEL A330 newish plane flight departed on time. Extremely efficient FA's very happy and obliging. Purchased a couple of beers outbound that were reasonably priced. Legroom sufficient for me and I'm 6'2. Arrived into Delhi 10 minutes early. Excellent all round service.
AirAsia X customer review,6,10,2011-10-27,,Overall not a bad flight. On return audio speaker at airport was not clear enough to hear what they where saying. They should call passengers at rear of plane on first so they don't have such a backlog of passengers waiting in the rain on the tarmac. Extra charges for DVD player food drinks and blankets etc is I suppose why it is a low cost carrier.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2011-10-16,,KUL-HND-KUL. There are Japanese Flight Attendants to assist non-English speaking Japanese passengers. Food was the standard AirAsia X fare although the timing of the service was not convenient for me (I just had lunch when we departed from KUL-HND). There was no problem delaying the food till later though. Luggage delivery at Tokyo Haneda Airport was a little slow - it took about one hour after arrival before we were able to leave the arrival hall. On the return flight the check in and boarding was very efficient and problem free. If not for the luggage delay and unfriendly time of arrival (10.30pm) at Haneda AirAsia X would have gotten a 9 rating from me.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2011-10-09,,Gold Coast to KL return. Seats are comfortable. Meals adequate and I that I could order munchies or drinks at a very decent price when I wanted. Only issue I have is that I was told I could hire an entertainment unit on board but they only had 10 and were all taken. Told to book online but no where was there a link. Other than that both legs were enjoyable and service top quality.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2011-10-05,,BKK-KL-LON. It was the cheapest one way ticket to England although the price got considerably more expensive throughout the booking process. The flight from BKK-KL was good the plane brand new and the cabin crew friendly. KL airport was ok for a 4.5 hr stopover it did have free wi-fi for up to 3 hrs which was of a reasonable speed but the selection of shops and places to eat was poor. Long haul flying on Air Asia is clearly not going to be as pleasant as with other airlines unless you pick the hot seats buy the entertainment the travel kit and food as they do cram you in to Economy. The planes are clearly designed for the smaller person and I was certainly relieved that I had bought the hot seat as 14 hrs in one of the cramped narrow seats would not have been pleasant. If you do buy all the extras then it does come nearer to the standard of a normal long haul flight and the staff are extremely friendly and the food was fine. Both flights were on time meaning that we arrived in Stansted a little early and the bags were waiting.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2011-10-05,,Flew 4 flights: Melbourne-Kuala Lumpur Kuala Lumpur-Paris Orly Paris Orly-Kuala Lumpur Kuala Lumpur-Gold Coast. All 4 were fine dep/arr on time. Service as expected - we prepaid our meals tasty but the portions were too small as previous reviewers mentioned. We purchased hot seat for KL-ORY-KL as this is the longer flight and worth every cent. Flights attendants worked hard and a great effort to keep the toilet clean.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2011-09-21,,Perth-KL-Stansted return in Premium. Initial flight older A330 both A340's and new 330 back to Perth. A good experience for the price. Easy check-in with separate line. Seats good on all and managed to sleep well. While food is small portions it was tasty with plenty more snacks to purchase as required. Crews friendly and helpful. A340 premium section behind first economy toilet used by economy the curtain never used but can understand it is just too hard for crew to enforce. Premium transit baggage at Stansted and Perth came off last though direct connects did come off first so system not set up to pick transit baggage. Transit through KL LCCT was fine its basic but works well with amenities and clean toilets.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2011-09-18,,I travelled to KUL-CHC return in August 2011 on standard seat. I found the seat ok and food is quite delicious. I already knew this is a no-frill airlines and of course I managed my expectations accordingly. The fare I paid was superb for such a long flight. Both flights were on-time.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2011-09-14,,ORY-KUL in Economy. Flight was turbulent but the captain kept us informed several times during the flight. Flight attendants were polite friendly and always smiling even when flooded with in-seat calls. Pre-paid food and snacks of excellent quality surprised considering it's a low-cost airline.
AirAsia X customer review,2,10,2011-08-21,,Incheon to KL roundtrip. I made a date change by phone and was told to pay at the airport. On arrival at the airport no change had been made. Forced to pay a higher fee to fly the day of the flight. Staff were polite but all seemed rather ill-equipped. I've flown Air Asia many times and found them fine for short flights. Once you pay for bags a blanket pillow and food on board the ticket price is about the same as any other carrier.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2011-08-14,,Flew Economy CHCH to KL and then lie flat return. Economy seats are very small and the head-support is poorly designed. Staff are very nice. You can buy almost everything you need food drinks blankets pillows duty free. There is no technology but you can rent a DVD player. I would suggest you take your own food and ipod. Lie-flat is very good. It's on a tilt but just put a pillow or blanket under your legs and it's fine. You get a basic meal and water bottle included. Despite limitations it's good value and they are upfront about their services.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2011-08-09,,UK to KL and KL to Korea. Good value for money. Service on board was okay flights were on time seats are relatively tight and narrow with reasonable priced food sold on board.
AirAsia X customer review,6,10,2011-08-09,,CHC-KUL-CHC (Premium and Economy). A330-300. Overnight flight in both directions. Premium seats excellent and comfortable enough to get a good sleep. FA's gave out duvets and pillows. Food same as Economy and was tasty. Would take own food next time. Return journey in Economy. Seating configuration 3-3-3 was tight. Seats were narrow and didn't seem to recline very far. However service was good and for the price was more than acceptable.
AirAsia X customer review,5,10,2011-08-08,,I found the service to be friendly enough but a little distant especially considering how many there seemed to be on our flight. The food was not great palatable is probably the best I could say. Flights left mostly on time although we were held up for 1 hr in Kuala Lumpur waiting for a passenger to get through immigration.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2011-08-07,,MEL-KUL-MEL Aircraft A330-300 looked fairly new interior in good condition. Leather seats 3-3-3 goes to 2-3-2 after row 44. Seat comfort is tolerable service is friendly. Pre-booked meals very cheap and tasty by airline food standards. Both flights on time. Would fly with them again especially for the price of their sale airfares.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2011-08-01,,SGP-KUL-OOL (Gold Coast) -KUL-SGP. THis is the first time with AirAsiaX and I was excited to try a long haul budget airline. It cost me S$388 (A$300) to go from Singapore to Gold Coast and back. What a price! It included a meal that I pre-booked and 25kilos of baggage upgrade. Seats: Impressive when you walk inside nice color of brown and red. The legroom is normal not that tight like the normal regional A320. They're using A340s so its a big aircraft. The width of the seat is the problem its tight. Especially if you are seated beside someone large too. Cabin Interior: It smelled and looked new and well maintained. The cabin looks bright and the toilets are clean and cool and smells clean. Service: AirAsiaX staff are friendly cheerful and always of service. The Nasi Lemak is very good. Prices are reasonable. Checkin: Organized fuss free.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2011-07-24,,MEL-KUL-MEL I have flown Air Asia many times within Asia and decided to give Air Asia X a go. My wife and I picked up tickets for A$400 return each very reasonable. A bit disappointed when we left 2 hrs late as someone was aboard in Melbourne with out a ticket and the FA had to count all PAX several times. Captain made up time and we landed 45 mins late. The seats are great if you are of a small build but I found the seats cramped. Nil inflight entertainment Inflight meals were standard airline food. I would fly AirAsiaX again if the price was right.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2011-07-15,,I cannot recommend this airline highly enough. It sets a new standard for budget airlines. I normally fly Melb-KL KL-Mum & back about twice a year and I find their service extremely consistent. The one trip that to me exemplified their high level of customer service is a trip I took between KL & Chiang Mai. I arrived for an afternoon flight to be told they had rescheduled the flight to the morning and had sent me an email notification (which I hadn't seen as i was travelling). I fully expected to be delayed to the next day. However customer service after a 20 min wait told me they could route me via Bangkok however the time gap in switching over to the domestic flight in Bangkok was only 1hr which was a concern. On the aircraft i briefed the air hostess who told me the captain had radioed ahead. On disembarking the same hostess told me they had located my baggage which was at the entrance to the bus to the terminal. The staff at the entrance to the bus told me a security guy would pick me up at the terminal & walk me through customs & security. The guy picked me up walked me through and checked me into the domestic terminal - all this was accomplished in the span of 45 mins. I have never been so impressed with an airline budget or otherwise. This level of customer service is unheard of.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2011-06-30,,KUL-ICN-KUL - out in Economy return in Premium. Both flights efficient and slept most of the way on the overnight return. Overall excellent value for money.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2011-06-29,,Recently did a PER-KUL in premium to get an onward connection for HKG. Last year I also did a PER-STN-PER return in the Premium seats. Everything was perfect the only gripe that I have is that if I need a flight at shorter notice say less than 3 months the cheaper Premium seats have all gone and it can become uneconomic for what you get. It would be nice to be able to have a static fare all year round.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2011-06-19,,MEK-KUL. We booked the extra legroom seats in Row 7. Great seats and we were amongst the first passengers to embark and exit. We enjoyed very tasty Nasi Lemak meal. Service requests very promptly answered by cabin crew. A tip for any couple flying in the Row 7 seats: Try to get a seat either side of the aisle as it is less comfortable in the middle seat of 3 with the narrow armrests. We also flew Air Asia from KUL-PEN and PEN-SIN. Both flights were on time. Paying the small extra fee for Row 1 seats ensured we were first on and first off and had extra legroom.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2011-06-17,,ICN-KUL last minute booking because of events in Tokyo. Still cheaper than KE and MH for 1-way. Pre selected pair of seats at the rear otherwise its 3-3-3 configuration. Thankfully flight about 70% load only and most passengers further forward. Partner went to middle row of 3 seats to spread out. I kept the pair seats with moveable armrests. Seats are narrow to allow 3-3-3 configuration. Crew friendly but looked tired still they managed to sell food/drinks prior to turning off lights. Being a redeye we had eaten prior in airport. A330 fairly new aircraft but very noisy seems they have skimped on the insulation! I always travel with my noise-cancelling headphones so not an issue there. Early arrival in KLIA hardly anyone at immigration. Good choice for the price paid.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2011-06-16,,"KUL-ORY with AirAsiaX A340-300. The flight was on-time and 95% full. The seat would be more comfortable if it's an inch wider no problem with the 32"" seat pitch though. For the lower fare you get what you pay for. 2 round of hot meals came with 350ml bottle water each food delicious and spicy (Asian meal) but the portion is very small. Water can be purchased onboard for a reasonable price. Cabin crew doing a good job overall."
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2011-06-08,,KUL-London round trip with economy seat. For low cost flight it's considered value for money. The only one which not satisfied me is the meal provided compare to other food provide from other airlines.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2011-05-31,,KUL-CHC-KUL. Flights almost full but seats were fine and everything went as planned with no delays. No problems with seat comfort after the upgrade food service was good. The only minor complaint was the not so great handheld entertainment device only 7 movies and very limited TV shows.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2011-05-25,,Several flights with AirAsia X and AirAsia March-April this year and considering price paid reasonably happy with the service provided on A330 and A320 aircraft. Pre booked food was fine seating okay on A330 and reasonably good on A320 aircraft. Most flights on time or close enough to not be a problem - so for a budget airline no issues.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2011-05-14,,PER-KUL-PER. Check-in fast. Friendly and pleasant flight staff. Would have like to have seen more of them however. Somewhat hard to track down. Puzzled by breakfast out of Perth which was roast beef veggies and potatoes. Was short a couple bucks for blanket back to PER but attendant let it slide. For the extra few dollars Hot Seats are the way to go as AA flights are usually pretty full.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2011-05-08,,My wife and I just returned from London yesterday. The flights staff lay flat beds were all faultless and we were so impressed. We felt very pampered and slept for most of the journeys and were only really awake for about 5-6 hours per long haul leg. Beds were so comfortable and meals great we didn't even miss the in-flight entertainment as we were asleep most of the time. Thanks Air Aisa X.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2011-05-01,,PER-KUL-PER excellent promo are and excellent product for a budget carrier. Aircraft out of PER half empty so got a row for sleeping. Cabin staff attentive able to save money and book a meal online before the flight - but only one meal can be pre-booked per sector. Return flight full in Economy night flight so cabin attentiveness not so important.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2011-04-25,,Given the cost of taking 5 family members from Singapore to London on any of the traditional carriers in business class I thought I would give Air Asia X a try in light of their low fares for lay-flat seat comfort and reputation for smiling can-do staff. From the point of embarkation in Kuala Lumpur to disembarkation at Stansted we found the ground and in-flight service to be exceptionally good – flight attendants were attentive courteous efficient with plenty of smiles and quick to follow up on any request we made. The food was excellent. The seat is terrific and I was genuinely impressed with the quality of in flight service I experienced. The service on the return leg was just the same – I was impressed by the remarkable level of consistency.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2011-04-14,,Have flown around 20 return trips with Air Asia X between Cooloongatta and Kuala Lumpur all in XL. On some of my earlier legs the cabin was an old 2x2x2 Business Class leased aircraft and very comfortable. Later there was a 2x3x2 configuration in a new aircraft and I was usually uncomfortable in that configuration and particularly so as I always sit on the left- hand aisle 1C usually and the steady stream of economy passengers banging past my seat to the lavatory used to drive me nuts and motivated me to lodge many complaints. Eventually my complaints (and many others staff told me about) were acted on and the XL cabins were re- configured and became a component part of the value for money AirAsia X represents. The cabin crews are fine and while there have been some less than wonderful experiences in both Cooloongatta and KL terminals as each was renovated when combined with KL's Tune Hotel as is from time-to-time required to make connections AirAsia X is an excellent Value-for-Money ride.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2011-04-12,,STN-KUL-PER and back. I was very pleased with both legs. We used online check in for all possible flights (online check in not allowed for flights into Australia due to visas) it was very efficient and useful. Flying out we had no hand luggage so able to get through check in quickly. On the way back bag drop was quick and efficient. I am 5 ft 6 and had ample leg room on all flights. We purchased AirAsia comfort packs which consist of an inflatable neck pillow blanket and eye mask these were excellent value for money and useful. We had 2 meals on the STN-KUL and these were fine we had both international and Malaysian.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2011-04-05,,"Gold Coast - Kuala Lumpur return. I flew economy out and Premium return. To avoid check-in queues I recommend the online check in it took 5 minutes at the luggage drop. Economy is a fairly comfortable although legroom is tight and for tall passengers I recommend paying the extra amount for one of the ""hot seats"" (either front rows or exit rows). The check-in did offer to block off 3 economy seats for me for an extra fee (as there was space on flight) but as a day flight I did not need to sleep. I was very impressed with the meal which also comes with a bottle of water. Other onboard food purchase items reasonably priced and a fair variety. I was looking forward to my return flight in Premium class. No need to do online check-in for Premium as there is a dedicated check-in queue for maximum of 12 Premium passengers. No business lounge for Air Asia X (pay per entry Plaza Premium Lounge available). Onboard staff offered a bottle of water lots of overhead space with only 12 passengers in the premium cabin. All passengers given a blanket and cushion. After takeoff staff offered to serve meal at a time of my choice. They also offered to hold any additional food items that I may want later in the flight. The standard meal is the same as that offered in economy class. The main benefit of Premium is the almost lie flat seat. Upon arrival we were able to exit the plane first get through passport control before other passengers. I have flown Air Asia X a number of times since their launch a few years ago and will definitely aim to fly Premium again on my future Air Asia X flights."
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2011-04-04,,STN-KUL return. I slept comfortably on their seat/bed and enjoyed delicious Malaysian / International cuisine. All highly recommended! I look forward very much to my next flights.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2011-03-14,,Gold Coast-Kuala Lumpur The seats were larger than expected with excellent legroom. The onboard food options were the best I have experienced very tasty and cheap. On time and altogether a great trip.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2011-03-08,,KUL-DEL. The website is very simple. I had to change dates but no hassles. Check In could be so much better but LCCT is like a bus stand. Got hot seats and they are worth it if you are tall or with an infant. Food was pre-ordered could have it any time (nice) drinks were available (beer and wine at stupid prices) and the flight was very smooth and right on time.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2011-02-17,,Mumbai to Kuala Lumpur return. Economy seat comfortable but after 2 hours legs get a bit uncomfortable as minimum space for feet. Food - we pre-booked vegetarian meal they gave us curry and small mineral water bottle. Food tasty but quantity of food very small. Recommend Air Asia and its very cheap.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2011-01-26,,SIN-KUL-HND return. Flew Premium outbound and had adequate rest with the angled lie-flat seat however it wasn't totally full-service. According to steward Premium passengers are only given 2 bottles of water and a pre-booked meal the rest have to be purchased. AAX should seriously consider including snacks and coffee/tea to make the service more enticing. Front- end cabin remained warm throughout the flight had the same “stuffy” experience with them to Australia two years back. For this it’s good to stay at the rear-end where it’s more cooling and less packed. Had to settle for a standard middle seat for the return leg but other than the lack of space (for tossing and turning) it was pretty comfortable. Checked-in online for both legs so was able to skip long queues for luggage drop and documents check all efficiently handled. Unfortunately we were not able to make use of the “transit” system as the SIN-KL and KL-HND sectors were booked separately and primarily because we had to check-in luggage otherwise it should be a breeze whizzing in and out of the transfer hall for connecting flights.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2011-01-05,,One of the best low cost carriers I have taken but check-in is an absolute disaster. On both segments of my KUL-ICN flights the check-in was a mess. I printed boarding passes ahead of time on the first leg but when I arrived at LCCT the bag drop off lines were longer than the normal check-in lines and it took well over an hour with no clear indications of where to go. On the return flight from Seoul it was incompetence by the check-in staff which led to 2+ hour long waits. I arrived at the airport 3 hours early and had to run to my flight to catch it after clearing check-in security and passport control. It takes 30 seconds for me to check- in online but for some reason the check-in crew are taking 15-20 minutes per pax. Other than check-in everything else was fine.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2010-12-08,,Melbourne through KL to London Stansted return. Like all budget airlines the staff numbers check-in facilities etc are a bit limited - you have a long check-in queue but they are very friendly and helpful. Like most cheap airlines there is no phone service at all but they do answer emails - and they looked after me well after they had to cancel a flight and re- schedule me. As others have mentioned the inflight services are trimmed down - no entertainment but everything else great and staff excellent. One thing about the plane - no air ducts - I didn't like that as I need fresh air.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2010-11-06,,Air Asia may be a budget airline but do you really expect passengers to pay for the heating too! Travelled a few times now including long haul to UK. and have found all flights freezing cold. Had to purchase blankets - I know extra income - but shouldn't be necessary. Cabin crew inattentive don't seem to notice people pulling on coats or coughing and sneezing but happy to sit huddled in their private little enclave chatting all time. When complaining about temperature they don't seem to understand problem and just say captains responsibility and nothing is done. Won't fly with Air Asia again unless improvement in this matter - just thawing out now after last trip!
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2010-10-29,,Melbourne to London and visa versa in Premier Class. Excellent great comfort. Air Asia make long distance travel affordable. Cannot fault the airline.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2010-10-27,,MEL-KUL-BKK Return on AirAsiaX. The planes are relatively new they leave and arrive on time staff are efficient and friendly and ensure that safety standards are met. There could however be more variety in the hot meals offered. Most importantly the airlines provides value for money and offers very good promotional deals. The one problem however is the inability to provide transit services at KL's LCCT airport. You need to have at least three hours to make an Asian connection given the length of time it take to clear Malaysian immigration and to make your way back into the airport to check in for your onward connection. If transit facilities were offered the airline would be my number one choice for travel out of Australia.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2010-10-25,,STN-KUL-PER-BKK-KUL-STN A340 and A330. Excellent low prices if you book really early. Kuala Lumpur Low cost Terminal quick and easy  not that bad. Flights virtually on time plenty of legroom surprisingly food onboard to buy really cheap. Cabin Crew were pleasant enough although seemed to lack social skills and not enough smiles. I would use them again although the first airline to let passengers use toilets during turbulence and seat belt signs are on!
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2010-10-20,,Good experience on new A330. Booked premium class which offers a lie-flat seat. Perfect for sleeping on my 6hr flight from Beijing (Tianjin) to Kuala Lumpur. Good value for money! Meals were goo and I don't mind paying for it since everything was clearly mentioned at the time of booking.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2010-10-05,,STN to KUL and then KUL to BOM both in premium. I am really impressed with Air Asia X. Flight from Stansted was slightly late leaving but made up time and arrived virtually on time. Slept soundly for 6 hours! (I hardly ever manage to sleep on planes!). FAs were very attentive and professional and the process at the LCCT in KL was great - out within 15 minutes of landing. KUL to BOM just as good left and arrived promptly service great and seats comfortable. AirAsia X is my preferred option when travelling to Asia.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2010-10-03,,Gold Coast-KL KL-Melbourne. Booked Hot seats in economy which was well worth it. Prebooked meals which were okay (typical airline meals). Service was as good as any other airline. Flights all on time. Would be good to be able to prebook the entertainment & get the arrival cards for KL on flight (no longer giving out). No hesitation in travelling with AirAsiaX in the future.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2010-09-30,,PER-KUL. Premium cabin quite nice and far superior to economy. Only 2 rows of 6 seats at the front of the cabin. Seats quite comfy. Food nice and a very pleasant flight experience all told.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2010-09-25,,Gold Coast-KL-Stansted. We had Premium seats on all legs apart from the first from Gold Coast. All flights on time seats the old business class cloth seats (they were fine) everything else same. Pre pay meal pay drinks etc. We have made about half a dozen trips and have found the airline to be most reliable.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2010-09-16,,Premium class from Melbourne to KL. Picked seating before leaving. Well manned check in and at Premium no queue to check in. Early arrival at the LCCT terminal - you have to walk about 100m from the plane. Straight through customs and then the seemingly endless drive to KL. Premium seat top notch. Meal basic but good - its served early in the flight with a bottle of water so you may want another seven hours later - if so it costs little. Good crew limited services as promised. Comfy seat and a good sleep en route.
AirAsia X customer review,6,10,2010-08-22,,KUL-STN-KUL and found the new Premium seats to be a bit of a disappointment. They are described as full flat bed but in fact they are still inclined at an angle so they're not horizontal which is what I had assumed from the name. A few of the seats at the rear of the old-style Premium class cabin seemed to have less of an incline than the new ones.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2010-08-22,,Perth-Kuala Lumpur. Cabin crew friendly food was buy-on-board. We arrived 20 minutes late in KL and missed our connecting flight to Penang. Took a while to get another flight to Penang but eventually consulted with our travel agent and got the next flight. Air Asia staff were considerate. Kuala Lumpur-Penang nice flight and enjoyable.
AirAsia X customer review,5,10,2010-08-17,,STN-KUL-LGK return. They do what they say in the tin and nothing more. Trek out to STN was a pain. The check in was okay although why online check in isn't allowed on the STN-KUL legs I don't know. As I was travelling with carry-on luggage only this would have avoided the need to queue up. Onboard economy class seat was very narrow and didn't have much recline - I probably shouldn't complain as it's a low-cost carrier. However the price for my ticket was not much less than flying with Thai via LHR which would have been a lot more convenient & comfortable. The return journey was on time mostly although again there was no possibility of online check in which meant that I was queuing at the LCCT terminal in KUL for a good hour. I noticed that the flight to MEL was being served by one check-in desk only! The resulting queue was almost out of the building! Overall an okay airline but only worth it when you can get one of their deal prices.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2010-08-12,,KUL-TPE return A330-300 for both legs. Pleasant flight generally with lovely and helpful flight attendants. Inflight meal was good nothing much to complain about. Pity that this airline is being let down by a very poor airport infrastructure at the LCCT.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2010-08-09,,PER-KUL-PER on new A330-300 in Premium Economy. Did not have high expectations but the airline and product surprised me. The lie flat seat is comfortable and I was able to get some sleep. The crew seemed to love their job answered call bells quickly and with a smile. The meal (Nasi Lemak on both legs) was fine. Be good if they had a western breakfast option for an 0700 departure. Don't get me wrong I love Malay food but the western option was smokey BBQ chicken - more suited to lunch or dinner. I would fly them again. Great value for money. The seat alone is worth it if you are happy with no frills on the meals and beverage.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2010-08-02,,STN to KUL return. Flights on time and check-in and ground services satisfactory. The flight attendants were smiling and helpful. All extras must be either prebooked or purchased onboard but I found prices fair and reasonable. The food was neither better or worse than most other carriers. One problem the seats are very narrow. They have 9 seats across (3x3x3) in an A340 and they have reduced the heights of these seats to give the impression that they are wider than they are. The outcome - you need to be very friendly with your neighbour. That being said if they keep their prices below their competitors I will certainly use them again.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2010-07-12,,MEL-KUL-HKT return. Value for money flights on time and for a budget airline great cabin service. We prepaid for meals seats and comfort kit. Meals were fine we ordered a kids meal for our 12 year old on the long haul flights and they came as good as any full service airline. Good Australian wine RM 18 (AUD $6) available. Seats recline to a comfortable level. I have flown economy and business on full service carriers and would have no hesitation booking AirAsiaX again for our next holiday.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2010-06-30,,Gold Coast-KUL. Full flight but lucky to have a spare seat next to me. Crew were nice and busy throughout the flight. I did notice that the prices are more expensive from the Oz end then flying from KL you can however take your own food on board. Legroom the same as legacy airlines. Online check in didn't seem to work. LCCT in KUL can be busy if 3 or more flights arrive at same time.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2010-06-28,,STN to KUL return on the new lie flat seats - on the outward leg the seat was broken although they offered to refund the cost of the outward leg. Return journey was comfortable. Disappointed with the portable e-player though. I feel the content could be better than a couple of films and several tacky US comedies. On the return journey I watched films on my laptop. Pre-booked food quality was OK but everything else had to be paid for although prices were reasonable. The lack of entertainment on board is the main drawback for AirAsia X although the new premium seats are as good as many full fare carriers and using Stansted rather than Heathrow a definite bonus.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2010-06-10,,Gold Coast-Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok then ChiangMai return. Plane was new. Our flight back to the Gold Coast from KL was cancelled - my husband was home in Australia and received a phone call regarding the cancellation. We were able to contact the airline in Thailand and confirm the changed flight. All went well. The staff aboard were very helpful. One of us was not well on the flight over and was upgraded. Only thing I would recommend is to book your extra luggage and meals. Meals were ok. I would be make sure you take a jumper and socks as it gets very cold on board.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2010-06-09,,The last time I flew on AirAsia X it was on their A330-300 aircraft with awful non-reclining seats. I took AirAsi X to Taipei return in May 2010 and flights were aircraft with new reclining seats. These are vastly superior as I did not feel cramped. I used AirAsia web check in to secure relatively good seats (did not pre-book seats) on Row 11. Baggage drop off was simple at the Kuala Lumpur Low Cost Terminal. Check in on the return flight at the Taoyuan Airport was more chaotic as they did not have any baggage drop off counter for web check ins. Taipei check in procedures are not compliant with AirAsia X's normal procedures as detailed on the web check in boarding pass - timings were about 30 minutes later than stated. Both flights on time. Compared to my previous experience AirAsia X has improved. I paid about RM 325 (US$100) for the return flight with 15 kg baggage and pre-booked meals on both flights. This is excellent value for money.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2010-06-07,,We travelled Gold Coast to Kuala Lumpur to Hong Kong back to Penang then Kuala Lumpur returning home to Gold Coast. Overall the flight and service was very surprising. We ensured that all meals and baggage was pre-booked flights were fantastic staff very friendly and planes were better than expected. Gold Coast to Kuala Lumpar was delayed 4hrs due to weather all passengers provided with Drink and meal vouchers. Considering this is budget airline this service was very unexpected and much appreciated. Seats are a little small however found them not too bad.
AirAsia X customer review,10,10,2010-05-01,,STN-KUL return our first trip with Air Asia X in the premium/business seats. Easy to check in at both airports inflight service was excellent. We do not mind getting less food and no free drinks/ inflight entertainment as on a 13/14 hour flight it is the seats that are important. Great value for money.
AirAsia X customer review,3,10,2010-04-20,,KL from OOL return. All I can say about this airline is that you get what you pay for. They do not give good service and they really couldn't give a stuff about me in KL. LCCT in KL is not a very nice place to stay at unfortunately I had booked a room at Tune Hotel for 2 days when I went over - even worse I booked it for 3 days on my return to KL - man what a mistake that was. I would advise anyone to spend the extra few hundred dollars and fly a full service airline. I booked the XL seats they were a waste small and uncomfortable.
AirAsia X customer review,6,10,2010-04-18,,"We flew with Air Asia X from KUL to COO beginning of April. It was a new A330-300 the seats were terrible! The width of the seats is at least 5-10cm less compared to other airlines. The seat pitch was reasonable for a budget airline. However the seats could not recline besides the sliding option and the seat cushioning was terrible. I read that Air Asia X has received many complaints on the seats and will replace their non-reclining seats by ""regular"" seats. However if regular airlines are slightly more expensive I will choose them! Pre-ordered food was worst I ever had. Make sure you get something to eat prior to boarding! (or take food with you!) However drinks are reasonably priced and inflight entertainment is also OK."
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2010-04-18,,STN-KUL-STN. We flew out 2355 departure from Stansted - check-in efficient and flight only a little late in departing. We were preboarded as we had children under 12 with us. The seats were comfortable ample leg room. We chose not to have prebooked meals but snacks were reasonably priced and bottles of water less than 50p. We booked the flights during a sale in June 2009 and paid just over £200 each return - amazing value for money particularly over Easter school holidays. The return flight from KL equally good but less easy to sleep due to other passengers talking/reading. The staff were pleasant and helpful. We also took internal flights to Penang from KL - on time and efficient. On the way out we stayed overnight at the Tune Hotel at the LCCT which was very convenient - a minute away by shuttle bus and easy to get back to the terminal early the next morning. All in all a great cheap way of taking the family away for Easter.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2010-04-06,,SIN-KL-TJN return. A333 equipped with new reclinable new seats fantastic legroom. Previously the awful black seats only slide forward had individual casing that housed the IFE screen which was a nuisance and legroom was pathetic. Although still 3-3-3 configuration the slim- line seats felt roomy. Had 3 seats to myself both ways.
AirAsia X customer review,,,2010-03-19,,Reading previous reviews I think I must have been either very unfortunate or else travelled on a different Airline. I've used Air Asia to travel around S E Asia for the past 4 years and on every single occasion my decision was made on the basis of cost. I've found Air Asia to be uncomfortable and unreliable so wasn't expecting much when I boarded a flight for Stansted from KL back in September 09 - and I was right not to. The plane was new but 50% of the seats seemed falling apart in particular the headrest cushions seemed to have developed a habit of detaching themselves from the rest of the seat. I found the 'slide mechanism' of the lower cushion that acts on AirAsia X flights as a seat recline totally useless making it the most uncomfortable seat I've sat in. On the 2 occasions that the precooked and paid for food turned up I couldn't eat a scrap. I couldn't even give the second serving away to my fellow passengers! At the end of the trip I paid more than if I'd used Thai International or Eva Air to Heathrow. The return trip in January was no better the plane new like the first but the headrests still kept falling off food hadn't improved and there was no more room. On nether of the flights were announcements concerning safety etc remotely audible and I just wonder how the airline has managed to pass the required safety standards. Trips not to be repeated neither cheap nor comfortable and for me two the worst flying experiences of 35 years. In my book they score minus 5!
AirAsia X customer review,,,2010-03-04,,Most recently my wife and I were stranded in Abu Dhabi when AirAsiaX announced they were canceling service to/from Abu Dhabi in January this year. They didn’t notify us their stranded passengers until Feb 10th. Neither did they offer any accommodation nor answer our emails asking for help. We had to get back to Malaysia on our own. They won’t reimburse our additional expenses either. They said they would refund the Abu Dhabi/Kuala Lumpur portion of our trip but it will take them 30-50 days to process the refund. Such an attitude! Watch out for these guys. If you are considering booking AirAsiaX it might be a good idea to develop a plan B - just in case.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2010-02-28,,KUL to MEL. Check-in at LCCT was a breeze but lack of Duty Free shops at midnight was a minus. A330-330 nicely cushioned seats. Crews professional and friendly. But it seemed that AirAsia X will remove its on-seat TV and replace with portable E-player. Unfortunately not a single E- player was available on that flight and no reason was given. Food choice limited. Liked the idea of paying more to get 30kg baggage allowance.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2010-02-18,,MEL-KUL Return. I initially paid $730 for the ticket but with the additional extra kgs and meals ticket price was close to $850 not that different price wise with MAS. Aircraft was new and clean seats and infotainment on each seats with USB food was delicious and service was good. MEL-KUL older A330 aircraft with no infotainment service generally good. Would fly again if price was cheap - happy to fly MAS or Emirates at a slightly premium price.
AirAsia X customer review,8,10,2010-02-05,,London to KL on AirAsia. Night flight out so slept fair bit. Booked extra leg room seat - worth it for the low cost. That said if the extra leg room is the 2 middle seats behind bulkhead not so good. Also the left hand seat to bulkhead is next to the entrance to the staff rest area so if you are spread out and asleep they will wake you to get in if necessary. Plane was older and the seats we had didn't retain much back support. Service ok. Its a flight at base cost after all. Return with same leg room seats. Day flight which always seems longer. Took the Malaysian meal package - great value decent food (less than £2) for 2 dishes and 2 small bottles of water. I would travel again. Also flew internally KL-Phuket newer planes great service. They fly to KLIA LCCT terminal which is not the main international KLIA terminal. If getting a connection next day again with Air Asia they use exclusively LCCT and hotels generally advertised are at the international KLIA a 25 min £10 drive in a taxi (pan Pacific Concord etc). Try Tunes hotel directly opposite LCCT on web cheap good clean like ibis etc.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2010-02-05,,KUL-STN: Comfortable seats delicious food (as always with Air Asia) and a bigger legroom than many other carriers! At this price Air Asia X is a great deal indeed. Just bring enough books/magazines/etc as there is no entertainment on board.
AirAsia X customer review,7,10,2010-02-03,,KUL-MEL Pre-booked exit row 15 for a fee. First impressions were good. My seat had ample legroom. However the flight deteriorated and got tedious. Cabin crew were unprofessional could hear them talking in the galley with their crew curtain shut. They disappeared partially in the flight and recline was non-existing only glide. I also found the XCite touchscreen irritating. Online chat feature had a glitch that kept jumping the messages back to the top and touchscreen sensitivity was very inferior. Overall Air Asia provides value for their cheap flights and would recommend it only if fare is cheap.
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2010-01-29,,STN-KUL-STN on a clearly older aircraft - seats generally comfortable (row 13 pre-booked both ways). Both flights on time (return arrived early). Check-in ok at both airports (impressed with LCCT - fast security passport control etc and luggage arrived very quickly). Pre-booked meals were reasonable and pretty good value. Cup of coffee for 5RM was reasonable and a decent size. Cabin crew friendly and attentive and very well presented. Cabin temperature fine and toilets clean. Pretty full outward flight less busy on return. Impressed for the money - booked 10 months in advance for lowest price.
AirAsia X customer review,5,10,2010-01-19,,"STN-KUL on Air Asia ""Oakland Raider"" aircraft. Our window seats row 16 were dreadful no padding we were sitting on metal. Headrests fell off tray in front would fall open when the passenger in front moved and as you can imagine not very good when sleeping. Food okay. the portable entertainment things were okay kept you distracted on a long flight. I don't believe all seats were as bad as ours. I spoke to Air Asia who say that they would be refurbishing this aircraft. Can anyone suggest a row which the seats were okay? I only know to avoid row 16. I have also travelled many times with Air Asia on the smaller flights were the service was great and have no other complaints."
AirAsia X customer review,9,10,2010-01-14,,STN-KUL-PER return. For the price we paid for December travel it was a bargain. Oldish ex Air Canada airbus on STD to KL route with no seat back IFE. E-players OK but limited choice. Take a good book. Asian food not great from Stansted but better on all other legs. Under 45 minutes to reclaim bags go through immigration and check in again at KL. Much better than expected. New Airbus KL to Perth with in seat IFE at a minimal cost. All in all apart from the lack of free drinks food and IFE everything was much the same as a full service airline.
