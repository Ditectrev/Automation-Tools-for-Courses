You have an Azure subscription that contains the following resources:
– A virtual network that has a subnet named Subnet1
– Two network security groups (NSGs) named NSG-VM1 and NSG-Subnet1
– A virtual machine named VM1 that has the required Windows Server configurations to allow Remote
– Desktop connections
NSG-Subnet1 has the default inbound security rules only.
NSG-VM1 has the default inbound security rules and the following custom inbound security rule:
– Priority: 100
– Source: Any
– Source port range: *
– Destination: *
– Destination port range: 3389
